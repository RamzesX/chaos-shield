# Authors

## Primary Author

**Norbert Marchewka**
*Creator and primary researcher*

### Contributions

**Physics (Ω-Theory)**:
- Originated the central thesis: "What if everything wants to teleport at c but can't because of mass?"
- Developed discrete spacetime framework with mass as geometric reshaping cost
- Derived information conservation as fourth Noether law (∂_μJ^μ_I = 0)
- Created three-tier wormhole classification (natural/information/mass)
- Established chronology protection from information conservation
- Proposed quantum entanglement as topologically unstable wormholes
- Connected action density to quantum computing temperature limits

**Mathematics (Conv(ℚ) Framework)**:
- Developed constructive mathematics using only rational numbers
- Designed quantum chaos security protocols

**Systems**:
- Created Unix/OS educational content

- Assisted in formalizing mathematical frameworks
- Helped develop Lyapunov stability analysis for entanglement
- Contributed to Appendix S (Stable Wormholes) formalization
- Provided literature research and cross-referencing
