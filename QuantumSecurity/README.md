# Quantum Security Papers

Post-quantum cryptography and identity systems research.

## Papers

### 1. Quantum-Resistant Identity System
**File**: [`quantum-identity-paper.md`](quantum-identity-paper.md)

A hybrid quantum-resistant biometric identity system featuring:
- Sliding-window blockchain (34KB/user at billion-user scale)
- Multi-layer security: biometrics + PUF + post-quantum crypto
- Adaptive update protocols (15-60 day intervals)
- Production-quality architecture specification

### 2. Quantum Chaos Protocols
**File**: [`quantum-chaos-protocols.md`](quantum-chaos-protocols.md)

Economic defense through traffic obfuscation:
- Differential privacy to create noise against quantum surveillance
- Makes "Harvest Now, Decrypt Later" attacks economically irrational
- Python implementation examples

### 3. Quantum Patient Observer
**File**: [`quantum-patient-observer.md`](quantum-patient-observer.md)

Defense against HNDL (Harvest Now, Decrypt Later) attacks:
- Comprehensive PQC migration framework
- NIST algorithm integration (ML-KEM, ML-DSA, SLH-DSA)
- Timeline 2024-2035 for quantum resistance
- Detection systems for harvest attacks

## Connection to Omega-Theory

These papers apply information-theoretic principles from the physics work:
- Information conservation (see [Appendix-F](../PhysicsPapers/Appendix-F-Information-Flow-Conservation.md))
- Computational resource constraints
- Entropy and information density

## Status

All three papers are complete with code samples and reference current NIST standards (2024).
