# Hybrid Quantum-Resistant Biometric Identity: A Feasibility Study for Post-Quantum Digital Authentication

**Abstract**

The advent of quantum computing poses an existential threat to current digital identity systems, which rely on computational complexity assumptions that quantum algorithms can efficiently break. This paper presents a feasibility study for a hybrid quantum-resistant identity system that combines traditional biometric authentication with hardware-based physically unclonable functions (PUFs) and post-quantum cryptographic algorithms. We propose a blockchain-based architecture for tracking natural biometric drift while maintaining continuous identity verification. Our approach leverages currently available technologies including secure elements, hardware security modules, and NIST-standardized post-quantum algorithms (ML-KEM, ML-DSA, SLH-DSA). Through theoretical analysis and architectural design, we demonstrate a practical implementation path that provides defense against both classical and quantum adversaries while handling the natural evolution of biometric signatures over time. This study offers a roadmap for next-generation digital identity systems in the post-quantum era.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 The Quantum Threat Landscape

The rapid advancement of quantum computing technology represents a fundamental paradigm shift in computational capability. Recent developments suggest that cryptographically relevant quantum computers (CRQC) capable of breaking RSA-2048 and ECDSA-256 may emerge within the next 10-20 years [1]. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has responded by standardizing post-quantum cryptographic algorithms including ML-KEM (CRYSTALS-Kyber), ML-DSA (CRYSTALS-Dilithium), and SLH-DSA (SPHINCS+) in August 2024 [2].

The "harvest now, decrypt later" threat model means that adversaries are already collecting encrypted data for future quantum decryption [3]. This creates an urgent need for authentication systems that combine multiple layers of security, including elements that are quantum-resistant by their physical nature rather than computational complexity alone.

### 1.2 Current System Limitations

Existing biometric authentication systems suffer from fundamental vulnerabilities:

1. **Static Templates**: Traditional biometric systems store templates that, once compromised, cannot be revoked
2. **Spoofing Vulnerability**: Single-factor biometric authentication can be defeated through various spoofing techniques
3. **Aging Drift**: Biological aging causes biometric drift requiring frequent re-enrollment or leading to increased false rejection rates
4. **Quantum Vulnerability**: Current cryptographic protection schemes are vulnerable to quantum attack

### 1.3 Proposed Solution Overview

This feasibility study explores a hybrid approach that combines:
- **Traditional Biometrics**: Proven fingerprint/face recognition technology
- **Hardware Signatures**: Physically unclonable functions that cannot be duplicated
- **Post-Quantum Cryptography**: NIST-approved quantum-resistant algorithms
- **Blockchain Drift Tracking**: Immutable ledger for managing natural biometric evolution
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Layered security that requires multiple successful verifications

## 2. Theoretical Foundation

### 2.1 Security Principles

Our proposed system leverages multiple security principles:

**Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs)**: Hardware-based security primitives that exploit manufacturing variations to create unique, unclonable identifiers [4].

**Post-Quantum Cryptography**: Mathematical problems believed to be resistant to both classical and quantum computers, including lattice-based, code-based, and hash-based schemes [5].

**Biometric Permanence and Variability**: While biometric features change over time, the rate of change is predictable and can be modeled [6].

### 2.2 Threat Model

We consider adversaries with access to:
- Current classical computing resources
- Future fault-tolerant quantum computers
- Historical encrypted data (harvest now, decrypt later)
- Side-channel attack capabilities
- Sophisticated spoofing technologies

We assume adversaries cannot:
- Physically clone PUF-enabled hardware
- Perfectly replicate living biometric features
- Reverse blockchain-recorded history
- Break post-quantum cryptographic assumptions

## 3. System Architecture

### 3.1 Core Components

The proposed system consists of four integrated layers:

        if not self.verify_liveness(raw_biometric):
            raise SecurityException("Liveness check failed")
        
        # Extract features without storing raw biometric
        features = self.extract_features(raw_biometric)
        
        # Apply template protection

        """
        latest_block = self.get_latest_block()
        
        # Calculate drift from last measurement
        drift_metrics = {
            'euclidean_distance': self.calculate_distance(
                latest_block.biometric, 
                new_measurement
            ),
            'correlation_coefficient': self.calculate_correlation(
                latest_block.biometric,
                new_measurement
            ),

            return True
        else:
            # Drift exceeds threshold - require additional verification
            return self.initiate_enhanced_verification()
```

   }
   ```

**Authentication Process:**

```python
def authenticate_user(claimed_identity):
    """

    """
    # Step 1: Biometric verification
    current_biometric = capture_biometric()
    stored_template = blockchain.get_current_template(claimed_identity)
    
    bio_score = fuzzy_match(current_biometric, stored_template)
    
    # Step 2: Hardware verification
    current_hardware = measure_puf()
    stored_hardware = blockchain.get_hardware_signature(claimed_identity)
    
    hw_score = verify_puf_response(current_hardware, stored_hardware)
    
    # Step 3: Cryptographic challenge
    challenge = generate_random_challenge()
    response = user_device.sign_challenge(challenge)
    
    crypto_valid = verify_ml_dsa_signature(response, challenge)
    
    # Step 4: Combined decision with drift tolerance
    if bio_score > 0.85 and hw_score > 0.90 and crypto_valid:
        # Check if update needed
        if time_since_last_update() > 30_days:

        return AUTHENTICATED
    else:
        return AUTHENTICATION_FAILED
```

def update_biometric_drift(user_id, new_biometric):
    """
    Blockchain-tracked biometric update
    """
    # Retrieve history
    history = blockchain.get_identity_chain(user_id)
    
    # Verify continuous identity
    if verify_gradual_change(history, new_biometric):
        # Create update block
        update_block = {
            'timestamp': current_time(),

While challenges remain in implementation and deployment, the core technologies exist today. The estimated costs are reasonable for enterprise deployment, and the performance metrics meet practical requirements for real-world use.

As quantum computing advances, the transition to quantum-resistant identity systems becomes critical. This study provides a practical roadmap for organizations to begin this transition using available technologies while maintaining compatibility with existing infrastructure.
