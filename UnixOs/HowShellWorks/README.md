A comprehensive technical documentation explaining UNIX shell architecture and implementation.

## Contents

- **[how-shell-works.md](./how-shell-works.md)** - Main documentation in English
- **[Wyjaśnienie](./Wyjaśnienie)** - Original article in Polish

## Overview

This repository contains detailed documentation about:
- Shell process architecture and system calls
- Terminal types and evolution (hardware terminals, virtual consoles, terminal emulators)
- Process management using fork() and exec()
- Input/Output flow and line discipline
- Pseudoterminals (PTY) architecture
- Signal handling and job control
- Modern terminal emulation in graphical environments
- Implementation examples and debugging techniques

## Topics Covered

1. **Core Concepts** - Shell, terminal, console, TTY, and PTY definitions
2. **System Architecture** - Layered architecture from hardware to user space
3. **Process Management** - Fork-exec model, process groups, and sessions
4. **I/O Subsystem** - Input/output flow, buffering, and redirection
5. **Terminal Emulation** - From hardware terminals to modern GPU-accelerated emulators
6. **Signal Handling** - Job control and signal delivery mechanisms
7. **Implementation** - Practical examples and minimal shell implementation
8. **Modern Developments** - Web-based terminals, GPU acceleration, and future directions
