# Omega-Theory

## Discrete Spacetime and Mass as Geometric Reshaping
{: .fs-9 }

## The Central Question

> *"What if everything wants to teleport at the speed of light—but we can't, because we have mass, and need to expend energy to reshape the geometry around us?"*

This simple question started it all.

## One Postulate, Everything Follows

$$\Lambda = \ell_P \cdot \mathbb{Z}^4$$

From this single statement—spacetime is a discrete Planck lattice—all of physics emerges:

| Insight | Consequence |
|:--------|:------------|
| Spacetime is discrete ($\ell_P$ lattice) | All physics emerges from Planck-scale jumps |
| All particles want to move at $c$ | Mass is what you pay when you can't |
| $\pi, e, \sqrt{2}$ can't be computed exactly | Action thresholds $S = n\hbar$ create quantum uncertainty |
| Information is conserved ($\partial_\mu J^\mu_I = 0$) | Fourth Noether law; chronology protection automatic |

---

## Key Equations

| Equation | Meaning |
|:---------|:--------|
| $\Lambda = \ell_P \cdot \mathbb{Z}^4$ | Discrete spacetime lattice |
| $d_{\text{eff}}(E) = 4 - 2E/E_P$ | Dimensional flow (CDT confirmed) |
| $\partial_\mu J^\mu_I = 0$ | Information conservation (Fourth Law) |
| $\rho_S = NkT/V$ | Action density (three variables!) |
| $F(T) = F_0/(1 + \alpha T)$ | Gate fidelity (Diraq 2024 confirmed) |

---

## Experimentally Validated

| Prediction | Status |
|:-----------|:-------|
| $F(T) = F_0/(1 + \alpha T)$ linear scaling | **✓ Diraq 2024** |
| Power-law $T^{-2.5}$ not Arrhenius | **✓ Confirmed** |
| No 4th generation fermions | Consistent |
| CPT exactly conserved | Consistent ($10^{-18}$) |

## Formal Verification

Unlike typical physics papers, Omega-Theory includes **10,000+ lines of machine-verified Lean 4 proofs**.

**Proven theorems include:**
- $E_P = m_P \times c^2$ (Planck energy-mass relation)
- Christoffel symmetry: $\Gamma^i_{jk} = \Gamma^i_{kj}$
- Metric compatibility: $\nabla_\mu g_{\nu\rho} = 0$
- **Fourth Noether Law** (information conservation)
