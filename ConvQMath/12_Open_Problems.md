# Conv(ℚ) Framework: Open Problems


## Real Analysis Gaps

### 1. Intermediate Value Theorem
**Problem**: Cannot be proven without completeness of ℝ
**Needed Development**:
- Alternative continuity concept using uniform ℚ-density
- "Approximate IVT" that works in Conv(ℚ)
- Computational interpretation of "crossing values"

### 2. Compactness Theory
**Problem**: Heine-Borel fails in ℚ (closed and bounded doesn't imply compact)
**Needed Development**:
- New notion of "computational compactness"
- ℚ-net theory for covering properties
- Effective versions of compactness theorems

### 3. Uniform Continuity
**Problem**: Standard definition requires completeness
**Needed Development**:
- Modulus of continuity with ℚ-bounds
- Effective uniform continuity
- Relationship to computability

### 4. Fixed Point Theorems
**Problem**: Brouwer, Banach fixed point theorems need completeness
**Needed Development**:
- Approximate fixed points in Conv(ℚ)
- Computational versions with error bounds
- Applications to differential equations

## Quantum Mechanics Challenges

### 1. Continuous Spectra
**Problem**: Position, momentum have continuous spectra in ℝ
**Needed Development**:
- ℚ-lattice approximations of continuous observables

- Heisenberg uncertainty in Conv(ℚ)

### 2. Path Integrals
**Problem**: Feynman path integrals sum over uncountable paths
**Needed Development**:

- Convergence of lattice approximations
- Connection to lattice gauge theory

### 3. Infinite-Dimensional Hilbert Spaces
**Problem**: QFT requires infinite dimensions
**Needed Development**:

### 4. Measurement Theory
**Problem**: Born rule probabilities, wavefunction collapse
**Needed Development**:
- ℚ-probabilistic measurement theory
- Decoherence in discrete settings

## Set Theory Reduction

### 1. Higher-Order Sets
**Problem**: Power sets, function spaces don't reduce simply to pairing
**Needed Development**:
- Computational interpretation of P(X)
- ℚ-encoding of infinite sets
- Constructive set theory alignment

### 2. Extensionality
**Problem**: Set equality via membership not captured by pairing alone
**Needed Development**:
- Computational extensionality
- Equivalence of encodings
- Relationship to type theory

## Category Theory

####1. Size Issues
**Problem**: "All sets" doesn't exist, how handle large categories?
**Needed Development**:
- ℚ-indexed universes
- Computational interpretation of size
- Relationship to type universes

### 2. Higher Categories
**Problem**: ∞-categories need careful foundational treatment
**Needed Development**:
- ℚ-simplicial sets rigorously
- Homotopy theory in Conv(ℚ)
- Model categories

## Research Program Priorities

### Immediate (1-2 years)
1. **Formalization in Proof Assistant**: Implement core Conv(ℚ) in Coq/Lean
2. **Approximate IVT**: Develop and prove computational version
3. **Basic Real Analysis**: Port undergraduate analysis to Conv(ℚ)

### Medium-term (3-5 years)
1. **Quantum Mechanics**: Rigorous ℚ[i] formulation for finite dimensions
2. **Numerical Analysis**: Prove algorithm convergence in Conv(ℚ)
3. **Complexity Theory**: P vs NP in Conv(ℚ) framework

### Long-term (5+ years)
1. **Quantum Field Theory**: Constructive QFT in Conv(ℚ)
2. **Consciousness Theory**: Empirically testable predictions
3. **Foundations**: Complete alternative to ZFC

## Implementation Guidelines

### For Practitioners
1. **Start Small**: Implement basic arithmetic and limits
2. **Test Thoroughly**: Verify classical theorems hold (approximately)
3. **Document Gaps**: Keep careful track of what doesn't work

### For Theorists
1. **Be Honest**: Acknowledge where completeness is genuinely needed
2. **Develop Alternatives**: Create new concepts replacing classical ones
3. **Prove Equivalences**: Show when Conv(ℚ) matches classical results

### For Educators
1. **Introduce Gradually**: Start with computational viewpoint
2. **Show Both Sides**: Compare classical and Conv(ℚ) approaches
3. **Emphasize Computation**: Focus on what can be calculated

## Conclusion

Conv(ℚ) represents a genuinely innovative approach to constructive mathematics with significant potential. However, it requires honest acknowledgment of its limitations and sustained development of new methods to address the gaps left by abandoning completeness.

The framework's value lies not in "replacing" classical mathematics but in providing a computational perspective that aligns with how we actually calculate and measure. With continued development addressing these open problems, Conv(ℚ) could become a valuable alternative foundation for computational mathematics and physics.

**Status**: Promising framework requiring significant further development
**Recommendation**: Pursue as research program, not revolution
**Key Insight**: Computation and convergence suffice for much, but not all, of mathematics
