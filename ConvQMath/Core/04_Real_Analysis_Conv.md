# Real Analysis Reconstructed: Limits, Continuity, and Calculus in Conv(ℚ)

## 1. The Foundation: Cauchy Sequences Without Completion

### 1.1 Internal Convergence

**Definition 1.1 (Cauchy Sequence in ℚ):** A sequence (aₙ) in ℚ is Cauchy if:
```
∀ε ∈ ℚ₊ ∃N ∈ ℕ ∀m,n > N: |aₘ - aₙ| < ε
```

Note: We never claim the sequence converges "to" something outside ℚ.

**Definition 1.2 (Conv Equivalence):** Two Cauchy sequences (aₙ), (bₙ) are equivalent if:
```
∀ε ∈ ℚ₊ ∃N ∈ ℕ ∀n > N: |aₙ - bₙ| < ε
```

**Theorem 1.1 (Conv(ℚ) as Quotient):**
```
Conv(ℚ) = {Cauchy sequences in ℚ}/~
```
where ~ is the equivalence relation above.

*Proof:* This forms an equivalence relation (reflexive, symmetric, transitive). The quotient inherits field operations. □

### 1.2 Convergence Rates

**Definition 1.3 (Rate Function):** A sequence (aₙ) has convergence rate f: ℕ → ℚ₊ if:
```
∀m,n > N: |aₘ - aₙ| < f(N)
```

**Classification:**
- **Polynomial:** f(n) = 1/nᵏ for some k
- **Exponential:** f(n) = λⁿ for 0 < λ < 1
- **Super-exponential:** f(n) = 1/n!
- **Hypergeometric:** f(n) = 1/nⁿ

**Theorem 1.2 (Rate Preservation):** If (aₙ) has rate f and (bₙ) has rate g, then:
- (aₙ + bₙ) has rate max(f,g)
- (aₙ · bₙ) has rate related to f,g
- Conv preserves rate classes

## 2. Limits and Continuity

### 2.1 Limits of Sequences

**Definition 2.1 (Sequential Limit):** For sequence (aₙ) and L ∈ Conv(ℚ):
```
lim_{n→∞} aₙ = L ⟺ ∀ε ∈ ℚ₊ ∃N ∀n > N: |aₙ - L| < ε
```
where |aₙ - L| means distance in Conv(ℚ).

**Theorem 2.1 (Limit Laws in Conv(ℚ)):**
1. lim(aₙ + bₙ) = lim aₙ + lim bₙ
2. lim(aₙ · bₙ) = lim aₙ · lim bₙ
3. lim(aₙ/bₙ) = lim aₙ / lim bₙ if lim bₙ ≠ [0]

### 2.2 Function Limits

**Definition 2.2 (Function Limit):** For f: ℚ → ℚ and a ∈ ℚ:
```
lim_{x→a} f(x) = L ⟺ ∀ε ∈ ℚ₊ ∃δ ∈ ℚ₊ ∀x ∈ ℚ:
    0 < |x-a| < δ ⟹ |f(x)-L| < ε
```

**Theorem 2.2 (Sequential Characterization):**
```
lim_{x→a} f(x) = L ⟺ ∀(xₙ)→a: f(xₙ)→L
```

### 2.3 Continuity

**Definition 2.3 (Conv-Continuity):** f: ℚ → ℚ is Conv-continuous at a if:
```
∀ε ∈ ℚ₊ ∃δ ∈ ℚ₊ ∀x ∈ ℚ: |x-a| < δ ⟹ |f(x)-f(a)| < ε
```

**Theorem 2.3 (Continuity Equivalences):**
1. f continuous at a ⟺ lim_{x→a} f(x) = f(a)
2. f continuous ⟺ preserves Cauchy sequences
3. f continuous ⟺ (xₙ)→x ⟹ f(xₙ)→f(x)

### 2.4 Uniform Continuity

**Definition 2.4:** f is uniformly continuous on A ⊂ ℚ if:
```
∀ε ∈ ℚ₊ ∃δ ∈ ℚ₊ ∀x,y ∈ A: |x-y| < δ ⟹ |f(x)-f(y)| < ε
```

**Theorem 2.4 (Heine-Cantor in Conv(ℚ)):** If f is continuous on compact K ⊂ Conv(ℚ), then f is uniformly continuous on K.

## 3. Differentiation in Conv(ℚ)

### 3.1 The Derivative

**Definition 3.1 (Conv-Derivative):**
```
f'(a) = lim_{h→0} [f(a+h) - f(a)]/h
```
computed as Conv(⟨n: [f(a+1/n) - f(a)]·n⟩)

**Theorem 3.1 (Differentiability ⟹ Continuity):** If f'(a) exists in Conv(ℚ), then f is continuous at a.

*Proof:*
```
|f(x)-f(a)| = |f'(c)||x-a| for some c between a,x
```
by mean value theorem. As x→a, right side →0. □

### 3.2 Differentiation Rules

**Theorem 3.2 (Derivative Rules in Conv(ℚ)):**
1. **(af + bg)' = af' + bg'** (linearity)
2. **(fg)' = f'g + fg'** (product rule)
3. **(f/g)' = (f'g - fg')/g²** (quotient rule)
4. **(f∘g)' = (f'∘g)·g'** (chain rule)

All equalities in Conv(ℚ).

### 3.3 Higher Derivatives

**Definition 3.2:** The n-th derivative:
```
f^(n)(a) = lim_{h→0} [Δₕⁿf(a)]/hⁿ
```
where Δₕ is the difference operator.

**Theorem 3.3 (Taylor's Theorem in Conv(ℚ)):** If f^(n) exists:
```
f(x) = Σ_{k=0}^{n-1} f^(k)(a)(x-a)^k/k! + f^(n)(c)(x-a)^n/n!
```
for some c between a and x, all in Conv(ℚ).

### 3.4 Optimization

**Theorem 3.4 (Extreme Value Theorem):** If f: [a,b]∩ℚ → Conv(ℚ) is continuous, then f attains max and min.

**Theorem 3.5 (Fermat's Theorem):** If f has local extremum at c and f'(c) exists, then f'(c) = [0].

```
where Pₙ are uniform partitions with mesh → 0.

### 4.2 Fundamental Theorem

**Theorem 4.2 (Fundamental Theorem of Calculus):**
Part 1: If F'(x) = f(x), then ∫ₐᵇ f = F(b) - F(a)
Part 2: If f continuous, then d/dx[∫ₐˣ f(t)dt] = f(x)

*Proof:* Via Riemann sums and mean value theorem. □

### 4.3 Integration Techniques

```

### 4.4 Improper Integrals

**Definition 4.3:** For unbounded interval:
```
∫ₐ^∞ f = lim_{b→∞} ∫ₐᵇ f
```
computed as Conv(⟨n: ∫ₐⁿ f⟩)

**Theorem 4.5 (Comparison Test):** If 0 ≤ f ≤ g and ∫g converges, then ∫f converges.

**Definition 5.1:** Series Σaₙ converges if partial sums form Cauchy sequence:
```
Σ_{n=1}^∞ aₙ = Conv(⟨N: Σ_{n=1}^N aₙ⟩)

**Tests for Convergence:**
1. **Ratio Test:** lim|aₙ₊₁/aₙ| < 1 ⟹ convergence
2. **Root Test:** lim|aₙ|^(1/n) < 1 ⟹ convergence
3. **Integral Test:** ∫f convergent ⟺ Σf(n) convergent
4. **Alternating Series:** |aₙ| decreasing to 0 ⟹ Σ(-1)ⁿaₙ converges
