# Information Flow Conservation as a Fourth Noether Symmetry

## A Fundamental Conservation Law for the Algebraic Structure Ω

**Abstract**

We identify a fourth fundamental conservation law arising from uniform motion symmetry within the geometric reshaping framework for discrete spacetime. This conservation law—**information conservation**—stands alongside energy, momentum, angular momentum, and charge conservation as a universal principle governing all physical processes. Like these established laws, information conservation applies universally: to nuclear explosions, radio waves, gravitational dynamics, quantum entanglement, and mechanical processes alike. 

The law arises from uniform reshaping invariance—the symmetry under which geometric reshaping patterns remain constant during motion at constant velocity. In this paper, we derive the general principle and then demonstrate its specific application to 4D spacetime geometry, where it manifests as the self-healing mechanism mediated by gravitons. However, the law itself is more fundamental than any particular application: it is a postulate of the algebraic structure Ω from which all physics emerges.

We present quantitative predictions for information flow rates, provide natural resolution of the black hole information paradox, derive the holographic bound from first principles, and propose experimental tests distinguishing this framework from conventional thermodynamic treatments. A key application resolves the apparent paradox of gravitational redshift: photons do not "lose energy" to gravity but rather transform information channels, encoding geometric witness information about the spacetime through which they propagate.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 The Fundamental Conservation Laws

Emmy Noether's theorem establishes a correspondence between continuous symmetries and conservation laws (Noether, 1918). Physics recognizes several such correspondences:

| Symmetry | Conservation Law | Applies To |
|----------|------------------|------------|
| Time translation | Energy | Everything |
| Space translation | Momentum | Everything |
| Rotation | Angular momentum | Everything |
| U(1) gauge | Electric charge | Everything |
| **Uniform reshaping** | **Information** | **Everything** |

These conservation laws are **universal postulates**. Energy conservation applies equally to a nuclear explosion, a radio transmission, a gravitational wave, and throwing a rock. It is not "the law of nuclear energy" or "the law of radio energy"—it is simply energy conservation, manifesting differently in different contexts.

### 1.2 The Fourth Noether Law: Information Conservation

We propose that information conservation holds the same fundamental status:

$\frac{\partial I}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot \vec{J}_{\text{info}} = 0$

This law applies universally:
- Nuclear processes conserve information
- Electromagnetic waves conserve information  
- Gravitational dynamics conserve information
- Quantum entanglement conserves information
- Throwing a rock conserves information

**The law is a postulate of the algebraic structure Ω—the deep mathematical foundation from which all physics emerges.**

### 1.3 Application to Geometry: Gravitons

In this paper, we derive the general principle and then focus on one specific application: **4D spacetime geometry**. When information conservation is applied to the geometric sector (metric tensor g_μν), it manifests as:

1. Defects in geometry must heal (information cannot be lost in holes)
2. Healing requires carriers: **gravitons**
3. Gravity emerges as information gradient

But this is one manifestation of a universal law, just as E = mc² is one manifestation of energy conservation.

### 1.4 Ω as Higher-Dimensional Geometry

The algebraic structure Ω is itself geometric—but in more dimensions than the 4D spacetime we observe:

$\Omega = \text{(geometry in } n > 4 \text{ dimensions)}$

Observable 4D spacetime is a **projection** of Ω. The fourth Noether law operates at the level of Ω, ensuring information conservation across all its projections:

- Projection to 4D geometry → Gravitational sector
- Projection to D_ent → Entanglement sector (see Appendix E)
- Projection to U(1) → Electromagnetic sector
- Other projections → Other physics

Each projection has its own manifestation of information conservation, but the law itself is singular and fundamental.

### 1.5 Scope of This Paper

We proceed as follows:
- §2-4: Derive the general fourth Noether law from uniform reshaping invariance
- §5-8: Apply to 4D geometry, deriving graviton-mediated healing
- §9: Discuss gravitons as information carriers in the geometric sector
- §9A: Connection to Einstein-Cartan torsion theory
- §9B: Photon propagation and gravitational redshift as information encoding
- §10-11: Broader implications and conclusions

**The mathematical derivation is general; the geometric application is specific.**

## 2. Mathematical Framework

### 2.1 The Reshaping Field

Define the reshaping field R(x,t) characterizing the local geometric deformation pattern. The Lagrangian density:

$$\mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\partial R}{\partial t}\right)^2 - \frac{c^2}{2}(\nabla R)^2 - V(R)$$

Under uniform motion, this Lagrangian exhibits invariance:

$$R \rightarrow R + \epsilon \cdot f(x - vt)$$

where ε is infinitesimal and f describes the reshaping profile.

### 2.2 Application of Noether's Theorem

The Noether current associated with this symmetry:

$$j^\mu = \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial(\partial_\mu R)} \cdot \delta R - \delta x^\mu \cdot \mathcal{L}$$

yields the conserved current:

$$j^\mu = (I, \vec{J}_{\text{info}})$$

where:
- I = information density (bits/m³)
- $\vec{J}_{\text{info}}$ = information flux (bits/m²·s)

### 2.3 The Conservation Equation

The continuity equation for information flow:

$$\frac{\partial I}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot \vec{J}_{\text{info}} = \sigma_{\text{info}}$$

where σ_info represents information sources and sinks.

**Critical property**: For uniform motion, σ_info = 0 (information neither created nor destroyed). For accelerated motion, σ_info ≠ 0 (information gradients emerge).

---

## 3. Information-Energy Correspondence

### 3.1 The Fundamental Relationship

The framework suggests reinterpretation of the energy-information relationship:

**Conventional view**:
$$S = k_B \ln \Omega \quad \text{(entropy from energy states)}$$

**Information-first view**:
$$E = k_B T \ln 2 \cdot I \quad \text{(energy as information processing cost)}$$

### 3.2 Mass as Bound Information

From the reshaping principle:

$$m = \frac{I_{\text{bound}}}{c^2}$$

where I_bound represents information content stored in the particle's geometric reshaping pattern.

This formulation explains:
- Massless particles carry information without storing it
- Massive particles store information in reshaping patterns
- E = mc² becomes E = I_bound (energy equals bound information)

### 3.3 Quantitative Information Content

For a system with information I:

$$E = \hbar \cdot f_{\text{reshape}} \cdot I = \frac{\hbar c}{\ell_p} \cdot I$$

where f_reshape = c/ℓ_p is the fundamental reshaping frequency.

**Numerical example**: For a 1 kg mass:

$$I = \frac{mc^2}{k_B T \ln 2} = \frac{(1)(3\times10^8)^2}{(1.38\times10^{-23})(300)(0.693)} \approx 3.1 \times 10^{40} \text{ bits}$$

## 3A. Algorithmic Information Connection

### 3A.1 Müller's Observer-State Program

Markus Müller (Vienna) develops an independent approach to fundamental physics from algorithmic information theory [Müller 2020]. The core insight: physical laws emerge from constraints on what observer memory states are algorithmically possible.

**Key principles of Müller's framework**:

1. **Observer as finite computer**: An observer's memory has bounded Kolmogorov complexity K(memory) < ∞

2. **Physics from typicality**: Physical laws emerge because most algorithmically simple memory states exhibit patterns we identify as "physics"

3. **Born rule derivation**: The probability measure |ψ|² is uniquely determined by structural requirements and typicality [Masanes, Galley, Müller 2019]

4. **Discrete time**: Time may be fundamentally discrete, with irreversibility arising from algorithmic constraints

### 3A.2 Correspondence Between Frameworks

The two frameworks—our geometric information conservation and Müller's algorithmic approach—appear to be **dual formulations** of the same underlying structure:

| Aspect | Geometric (this work) | Algorithmic (Müller) |
|--------|----------------------|---------------------|
| **Information measure** | Continuous density I(x,t) | Discrete complexity K(string) |
| **Conservation** | ∂_μJ^μ_I = 0 | K cannot decrease |
| **Time definition** | dt = dS/L | Discrete computation steps |
| **Observer role** | Samples at c/ℓ_P | Bounded K(memory) |
| **Uncertainty source** | Computational truncation | Typicality |
| **Probability measure** | Not derived | |ψ|² from typicality |

### 3A.3 Action-Complexity Correspondence

**Conjecture 3A.1** (Action-Complexity Duality): For physical systems, the dimensionless action S/ℏ corresponds to the Kolmogorov complexity K of the observer's memory state:

$$\frac{S}{\hbar} \sim K(\text{observer memory})$$

**Supporting evidence**:

1. **Extensivity**: Both S and K are extensive—they scale with system size
2. **Monotonicity**: Both increase for closed systems (action accumulates; K cannot decrease)
3. **Time definition**: Both provide time ordering (thresholds S = nℏ; computation steps)
4. **Information content**: Both measure "computational work" to specify state

**Physical interpretation**: The action integral measures the geometric computational work required by the universe. The Kolmogorov complexity measures the algorithmic computational work required to specify the observer's memory. The correspondence suggests these are the same quantity viewed from different perspectives.

### 3A.4 Synthesis: Mechanism + Measure = Complete QM

The synthesis of both frameworks provides a complete derivation of quantum mechanics:

**This framework provides the MECHANISM**:
- Discrete spacetime with action thresholds S = nℏ
- Computational deadlines from irrational geometric factors
- Forced transitions before calculations complete
- Irreducible uncertainty from truncation

**Müller provides the MEASURE**:
- Typicality selects |ψ|² among all probability assignments
- Unique probability measure consistent with QM structure
- No free parameters in probability rule

**Together**: The mechanism (computational truncation) creates uncertainty; the measure (typicality) determines that the uncertainty follows |ψ|².

$$\text{Why uncertainty?} \longleftarrow \text{This framework}$$
$$\text{Which probability rule?} \longleftarrow \text{Müller}$$

### 3A.5 Information Conservation: Two Perspectives

The fourth Noether law (information conservation) admits interpretation in both frameworks:

**Geometric perspective** (this paper):
$$\partial_\mu J^\mu_I = 0$$

Information is a continuous fluid that flows through spacetime. The divergence of the information current vanishes—information is neither created nor destroyed.

**Algorithmic perspective** (Müller):
$$\frac{dK}{d(\text{computation})} \geq 0$$

Kolmogorov complexity cannot decrease under any computable transformation. This is algorithmic irreversibility—the arrow of time.

**Unification**: Both statements forbid the same thing: **genuine information loss**. The geometric formulation describes information flow through space; the algorithmic formulation describes information transformation in computation. They are dual descriptions of a single constraint.

### 3A.6 Open Problems

1. **Rigorous proof of Action-Complexity correspondence**: The conjecture S/ℏ ~ K(memory) requires formal proof relating continuous action to discrete complexity

2. **Observer emergence**: How does a bounded-K observer emerge from geometric information flow? This connects to the measurement problem

3. **Entanglement complexity**: How does entanglement affect the K of joint systems? This connects to Appendix E

4. **Cosmological implications**: Does algorithmic typicality explain the initial state of the universe?

## 4. Planck-Scale Violations and Macroscopic Conservation

### 4.1 Microscopic Uncertainty

At the Planck scale, information conservation experiences violations due to computational incompleteness in calculating geometric factors:

$$\Delta I \cdot \Delta t \geq \frac{\hbar}{2k_B T \ln 2} + \delta(\pi, e, \sqrt{2})$$

The δ term arises from truncated calculations of irrational geometric factors at action thresholds.

### 4.2 Statistical Emergence

For N particles:

$$I_{\text{total}} = \sum_i I_i \pm \sqrt{N} \cdot \delta I_{\text{Planck}}$$

The relative uncertainty:

$$\frac{\Delta I}{I} \sim \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \rightarrow 0 \quad \text{as } N \rightarrow \infty$$

Perfect conservation emerges statistically at macroscopic scales.

### 4.3 Dual Formulation: Algorithmic Information Conservation

**Remark 4.3 (Algorithmic Dual)**: The fourth Noether law ∂_μJ^μ_I = 0 admits an algorithmic interpretation through Müller's framework [Müller 2020]. Both formulations encode information conservation, but via different mathematical structures:

| Formulation | Mathematical Object | Conservation Statement |
|-------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Geometric (this paper) | Continuous current J^μ_I | ∂_μJ^μ_I = 0 |
| Algorithmic (Müller) | Kolmogorov complexity K | K(closed system) non-decreasing |

**Connection**: Müller's framework conserves information via algorithmic irreversibility—the Kolmogorov complexity K of a closed system cannot decrease under any computable transformation. This appears to be the algorithmic dual of our geometric conservation law:

$$\partial_\mu J^\mu_I = 0 \quad \longleftrightarrow \quad \frac{dK}{d(\text{computation steps})} \geq 0$$

**Interpretation**:
- The geometric formulation describes information flow through spacetime
- The algorithmic formulation describes information transformation in computation
- Both forbid the same thing: genuine information loss

**Conjecture (Action-Complexity Correspondence)**: For physical systems, the action integral S and the algorithmic complexity K of the observer's memory state are related:

$$\frac{S}{\hbar} \sim K(\text{observer memory})$$

Both quantities are extensive, monotonically increasing for closed systems, and provide measures of "computational work" required to specify system state. A rigorous proof of this correspondence would unify the geometric and algorithmic formulations.

## 5. Applications to Established Physics

### 5.1 Black Hole Information

At the event horizon, information flow symmetry breaks:

$$J_{\text{info}}^{\text{radial}} \rightarrow 0 \quad \text{at } r = r_s$$

Hawking radiation (Hawking, 1975) carries information via:

$$\frac{dI_{\text{BH}}}{dt} = -\frac{A}{4\ell_p^2} \cdot \frac{k_B T_H}{\hbar}$$

**Resolution**: Information is conserved but undergoes extreme time dilation for radial flow at the horizon. The apparent paradox arises from coordinate artifacts rather than genuine information loss.

### 5.2 Holographic Bound

Maximum information flow through a surface:

$$J_{\text{max}} = \frac{c}{4\ell_p^2} = \frac{c^3}{4G\hbar} \text{ bits/m}^2\text{·s}$$

This matches the Bekenstein-Hawking bound (Bekenstein, 1973; Susskind, 1995). The holographic principle emerges as a constraint on information throughput rather than storage capacity.

### 5.3 Quantum Entanglement

Entangled particles share information flow patterns:

$$I_{\text{total}} = I_A + I_B + I_{\text{entangled}}$$

where I_entangled represents shared information that cannot be localized to either particle.

Measurement breaks flow symmetry, localizing information:
$$I_{\text{entangled}} \rightarrow I_A \text{ or } I_B$$

---

## 6. Gravitational Information Theory

### 6.1 Einstein Equations Reformulation

We propose Einstein's field equations can be expressed as:

$$R_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2}g_{\mu\nu}R = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4} T_{\mu\nu}^{\text{info}}$$

where the information stress-energy tensor:

$$T_{\mu\nu}^{\text{info}} = \frac{\hbar c}{\ell_p^3} \cdot I_{\mu\nu}$$

### 6.2 Gravity as Information Gradient

The gravitational field emerges from information flow disruption:

$$g_{\mu\nu} = \eta_{\mu\nu} + h_{\mu\nu}^{\text{info}}$$

where h_μν^info represents perturbations from non-uniform information flow.

**Uniform motion**: ∂h_μν^info/∂t = 0 (no gravitational radiation)
**Acceleration**: ∂h_μν^info/∂t ≠ 0 (gravitational waves)

This provides physical interpretation for why accelerated masses radiate while uniformly moving masses do not.

---

## 7. Experimental Predictions

### 7.1 Quantum Computing Signatures

For quantum computers with n qubits:

$$I_{\text{flow}} = n \cdot f_{\text{clock}} \cdot (1 - \epsilon_{\text{error}})$$

**Prediction**: Error rates should increase with acceleration:

$$\epsilon_{\text{error}}(a) = \epsilon_0 + \frac{a \cdot \ell_p}{c^2} \cdot \delta_{\text{info}}$$

### 7.2 Gravitational Decoherence

Information flow disruption near massive objects:

$$\Gamma_{\text{decoherence}} = \frac{GM}{rc^2} \cdot \frac{I_{\text{system}}}{\hbar}$$

This predicts enhanced decoherence in gravitational fields, testable with quantum systems at varying altitudes or in space-based experiments.

### 7.3 Unruh Temperature Corrections

Modified Unruh temperature for accelerating observers:

$$T_{\text{Unruh}} = \frac{\hbar a}{2\pi c k_B} \cdot (1 + \delta_{\text{info}})$$

where δ_info ~ (ℓ_p·a/c²) represents information flow corrections.

---

## 8. Connections to Existing Frameworks

### 8.1 Entropic Gravity

Verlinde's entropic gravity (Verlinde, 2011) emerges naturally:

$$F = T \nabla S = k_B T \nabla I$$

Gravity as entropic force becomes gravity as information gradient.

### 8.2 AdS/CFT Correspondence

The bulk/boundary duality reflects information flow conservation:
- Bulk gravity = Information flow in volume
- Boundary CFT = Information flow on surface
- Equivalence: Flow through volume equals flow across boundary

### 8.3 Quantum Error Correction

The universe may employ information flow conservation for error correction (Lloyd, 2000):
- Local violations at Planck scale represent errors
- Conservation laws function as error correction codes
- Gravity provides error syndrome detection

---

## 9. Gravitons as Information Flow Carriers

### 9.1 Physical Mechanism of Information Flow

The conservation law ∂_μJ^μ_I = 0 requires a physical mechanism for information transport. We identify gravitons as the carriers of information flow (see Appendix G for detailed treatment).

**Proposition 9.1** (Graviton-Information Correspondence): The information current is carried by graviton flux:

$J^\mu_I = \sum_g n_g \cdot I_g \cdot v^\mu_g$

where:
- n_g = graviton number density
- I_g ≈ 2.32 bits (information per graviton)
- v^μ_g = graviton 4-velocity (null: |v| = c)

### 9.2 Emergent Graviton Interpretation

Gravitons do not exist as fundamental particles waiting to carry information. Rather, they **emerge** wherever information gradients exist:

$\nabla I \neq 0 \implies \text{graviton emergence}$

This resolves the puzzle of why gravitons are never detected individually: they only exist where information must flow, and detecting them would require resolving the Planck scale.

### 9.3 Self-Healing Mechanism

Information conservation mandates topological self-healing (see Appendix D). Gravitons are the physical carriers of this healing:

1. **Defect creates information discontinuity**: ΔI ≠ 0 at defect
2. **Conservation demands repair**: ∂_μJ^μ_I = 0 cannot hold with discontinuity
3. **Graviton emerges**: carries repair instruction (2.32 bits)
4. **Heals defect**: restores ∇I → 0 locally
5. **Graviton absorbed**: information redistributed

### 9.4 Force Unification Perspective

If gravitons carry geometric information, other force carriers may carry other types of information:

| Carrier | Information Type | Conservation |
|---------|-----------------|-------------|
| Graviton | Geometric (g_μν) | 4th Noether |
| Photon | Phase U(1) | Charge conservation |
| W±, Z | Chirality SU(2) | Weak isospin |
| Gluons | Color SU(3) | Color charge |

**Hypothesis**: All conservation laws arise from information flow requirements for different aspects of Ω.

### 9.5 Universal Law, Specific Application

**Clarification**: The fourth Noether law (information conservation) is **universal**—it applies to all physics, just as energy conservation does. One can transmit information via radio waves, via quantum entanglement, or by throwing a rock at someone—each method conserves information, each operates through different physics.

In this paper, we have applied the universal law to **4D spacetime geometry**:

| The Universal Law | This Paper's Application |
|-------------------|-------------------------|
| Information is conserved | Applied to metric g_μν |
| Flow requires carriers | Carriers = gravitons |
| Defects must heal | Geometric self-repair |

Other applications of the same law:

| Domain | Carrier | Treatment |
|--------|---------|----------|
| 4D geometry | Gravitons | **This paper** |
| EM sector | Photons | Separate work |
| D_ent (entanglement) | Adjacency | Appendix E |
| Mechanical | Matter | Classical physics |

The fourth Noether law is a **postulate of Ω**—the algebraic foundation underlying all physics. This paper demonstrates one consequence: graviton-mediated healing of spacetime. The law itself is deeper than any single application.

### 9.6 Gravity as Information Gradient (Revisited)

Section 6.2 stated that gravity emerges from information gradients. With the graviton interpretation:

$\vec{g} = -\frac{c^4}{8\pi G} \nabla I = -\frac{c^4}{8\pi G} \cdot \frac{\Phi_g}{\kappa}$

Gravitational acceleration equals graviton flux (up to constants). Mass curves spacetime because mass creates information deficits requiring repair—gravitons flow toward mass.

## 9A. Spin-Information Coupling: Connection to Einstein-Cartan Theory

### 9A.1 Fermion Spin as Information Source

The fourth Noether law ∂_μJ^μ_I = 0 admits a natural extension when fermion spin is included. Nikodem Popławski's Einstein-Cartan cosmology [2010, 2016, 2021] shows that fermion intrinsic spin generates spacetime torsion. We demonstrate here that spin also **sources information current**.

**Theorem 9A.1** (Spin-Information Coupling): For Dirac fermions, the information conservation equation becomes:

$$\partial_\mu J^\mu_I = \sigma_I^{\text{spin}}$$

where the spin source term:

$$\sigma_I^{\text{spin}} = \alpha\nabla_\mu(\bar{\psi}\gamma^\mu\gamma^5\psi)$$

with α = ℏ/(2m_P c).

*Proof*:

**Step 1**: The axial current of a Dirac fermion:
$$j^\mu_5 = \bar{\psi}\gamma^\mu\gamma^5\psi$$

**Step 2**: The axial anomaly couples j^μ_5 to geometric quantities:
$$\partial_\mu j^\mu_5 = \frac{1}{16\pi^2}R_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}\tilde{R}^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}$$

**Step 3**: In discrete spacetime, the Pontryagin density becomes:
$$R\tilde{R} = \frac{1}{\ell_P^4}\mathcal{D}_{\mu\nu}\tilde{\mathcal{D}}^{\mu\nu}$$

**Step 4**: Defects 𝒟_μν create information gradients (Appendix D). Therefore:
$$\partial_\mu j^\mu_5 \propto \partial_\mu J^\mu_I$$

**Step 5**: Identifying the proportionality constant through dimensional analysis:
$$\sigma_I^{\text{spin}} = \alpha\partial_\mu j^\mu_5$$

∎

### 9A.2 Torsion-Information Correspondence

The fundamental correspondence linking Popławski's torsion to information gradients:

$$\boxed{S^\lambda_{\mu\nu} = \beta\epsilon^{\lambda\rho\sigma\tau}\nabla_{[\mu}J_{I,\nu]\rho}u_\sigma}$$

where β = ℓ_P³/(ℏc) and u_σ is the 4-velocity of the spin source.

**Physical interpretation**: Torsion measures the **curl of information flow**. Where the information current has non-zero vorticity, torsion appears. This unifies:

- **Popławski**: Torsion arises from fermion spin
- **Omega-Theory**: Information is conserved via ∂_μJ^μ_I = 0

Into the synthesis: **Spin is rotational information flow**.

### 9A.3 Spin as Bound Information Rotation

**Proposition 9A.1**: A spinning fermion represents information executing closed rotation:

$$\oint J^\mu_I \cdot dl = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot n_{\text{rotation}}$$

where n_rotation is the number of information loops.

For spin-1/2 particles: n_rotation = 1 (single rotation per period).
For spin-1 particles: n_rotation = 2 (double rotation per period).

This explains the spin-statistics theorem from an information perspective:
- **Fermions** (half-integer spin): Information completes odd loops → antisymmetric exchange
- **Bosons** (integer spin): Information completes even loops → symmetric exchange

### 9A.4 Modified Conservation Equation with Spin

The complete information conservation equation including spin sources:

$$\frac{\partial I}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot \vec{J}_{\text{info}} = \sigma_I^{\text{spin}} + \sigma_I^{\text{graviton}}$$

where:
- σ_I^spin = spin-induced information source (Section 9A.1)
- σ_I^graviton = graviton-mediated information transfer (Section 9.3)

In equilibrium (healed spacetime): σ_I^spin + σ_I^graviton = 0 (sources balance sinks).

### 9A.5 Implications for the Black Hole Information Paradox

The spin-information coupling provides additional resolution mechanisms for the black hole information paradox:

1. **Information carried by spin**: Infalling fermions carry information in their spin states
2. **Torsion at horizon**: High spin density at horizon creates torsion
3. **Torsion bounce** (Popławski): Information transfers through wormhole to baby universe
4. **Conservation preserved**: Total information (parent + baby) conserved

This complements Section 5.1's treatment by providing the **physical mechanism** for information transfer.

## 9B. Photon Propagation and Gravitational Redshift as Information Encoding

### 9B.1 The Apparent Paradox

Gravitational redshift presents an apparent puzzle within energy-centric frameworks: a photon climbing out of a gravitational well loses energy (frequency decreases), yet this energy does not appear to be deposited anywhere in the geometry. The stress-energy tensor T^EM_μν of the electromagnetic field couples to spacetime curvature, but individual photons do not seem to "pay" for their passage through curved geometry in the same way massive particles do.

Within the geometric reshaping framework, this puzzle dissolves completely. The resolution hinges on a fundamental distinction established in §3.2:

**Massive particles**: Store information in reshaping patterns (I_bound ≠ 0)
**Massless particles**: Carry information without storing it (I_bound = 0)

### 9B.2 Photons as Information Carriers, Not Storers

**Definition 9B.1** (Photon Information Content): A photon carries information in three distinct channels:

$I_{\text{photon}} = I_{\text{spectral}} + I_{\text{phase}} + I_{\text{polarization}}$

where:
- $I_{\text{spectral}} = \log_2(E/\Delta E)$ — spectral information (frequency resolution)
- $I_{\text{phase}}$ — phase information relative to source
- $I_{\text{polarization}} = 1$ bit — polarization state

**Proposition 9B.1** (No Reshaping Cost for Photons): Photons propagating through discrete spacetime do not incur geometric reshaping costs.

*Proof*:

1. The reshaping energy (Main Paper §2.4) is:
   $E_{\text{reshape}} = mc^2 \cdot f(R, \pi, e, \sqrt{2})$

2. For photons, $m = 0$, therefore:
   $E_{\text{reshape}}^{\text{photon}} = 0$

3. Consequently, photons do not create computational defects δ(π, e, √2) during propagation.

4. Without defects, no healing is required—photons do not emit gravitons. □

**Physical interpretation**: Photons do not participate in geometric reshaping or the healing flow. However, this does not mean propagation is "free."

### 9B.2A The Gravitational Field as Information-Processing Medium

**Key insight from information conservation**: The fourth Noether law requires that information about geometry must propagate—but propagation cannot be free. If an observer receives information about the gravitational potential of a distant star (via photon redshift), that information transfer must have a cost.

**Proposition 9B.1A** (G Field as Active Medium): The gravitational field acts as an **active information-processing medium**, not a passive background:

| Classical Maxwell in curved spacetime | Information-theoretic view |
|---------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Geometry is passive background | G field actively processes EM |
| EM "feels" curvature via metric | G field extracts toll from EM |
| No energy exchange (coordinate effect) | Information cost paid |
| One-way: geometry dictates | Transaction: G transforms EM |

**Definition 9B.1A** (Propagation Cost): For a photon traversing curved spacetime, the information cost per discrete step is:

$\delta I_{\text{cost}} = f(R_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}) \cdot \ell_P$

where $f$ is a function of the local Riemann tensor, and $\ell_P$ is the Planck length.

**Critical properties**:
1. **Geometry-dependent**: Cost increases with local curvature (more curved → higher toll)
2. **Cumulative**: Total cost integrates along the photon worldline
3. **Asymmetric**: G transforms EM, but EM does not transform G (except at horizons)
4. **c remains invariant**: The photon always propagates at c locally—what changes is geometry, not speed

**Critical distinction: What changes vs. what remains constant**:

| What changes | What remains constant |
|--------------|----------------------|
| Tensor F_μν (energy, frequency, polarization) | Local propagation speed = c |
| Effective distances (geometry) | Rate of EM tensor transformation |
| Observed frequency (redshift) | Photon's local experience of c |

The "observed slowdown" near massive objects (Shapiro delay) reflects the photon experiencing **more geometry to traverse**, not a reduction in the fundamental propagation rate. The photon still executes each Planck step at c, but the number of steps differs from flat space as measured by a distant observer.

**Physical picture**:

**Compatibility with General Relativity**:

This interpretation does not contradict GR—it **extends** it. GR correctly describes the kinematics (what happens); the information-theoretic framework explains the dynamics (why it happens):

| General Relativity | Information-theoretic extension |
|--------------------|--------------------------------|
| Describes WHAT happens | Explains WHY it happens |
| Geometry provides connection coefficients | Connection coefficients encode information cost |
| Redshift is coordinate effect (kinematic) | Redshift records information transaction (dynamic) |
| Equations are correct | Equations have physical interpretation |

We do not "replace" Maxwell in curved spacetime—we add that the geometric information encoded in the covariant derivative has a **cost**. The standard formulation $\nabla_\mu F^{\mu\nu} = J^\nu$ remains correct; we add that using this geometry requires payment.

**Theorem 9B.1A** (Asymmetric Interaction Hierarchy):

$\text{G} \xrightarrow{\text{transforms}} \text{EM} \quad \text{(always)}$
$\text{EM} \xrightarrow{\text{transforms}} \text{G} \quad \text{(only at } E \gtrsim E_P \text{)}$

*Justification*:

1. **G → EM**: The gravitational tensor transforms the EM tensor at every propagation step. This is the "toll" for information about geometry.

2. **EM → G**: Only at extreme energies (approaching Planck scale) does the EM field carry enough energy to create geometric defects requiring healing. At a black hole horizon, E_photon → ∞ (blueshift), crossing the threshold where EM finally affects G—the photon is absorbed.

**Corollary 9B.1A** (Black Hole as Threshold): The black hole horizon represents the boundary where the G↔EM interaction becomes bidirectional. Below horizon energy scales, G dominates; at horizon scales, EM finally "pays enough" to modify G.

### 9B.2B Observational Constraints on the Transformation Operator

Three classes of observation constrain the form of the transformation operator $\mathcal{T}[R_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}]$:

**1. Gravitational Lensing** (G changes EM direction):
- Light bends around massive objects
- Deflection angle: $\alpha = 4GM/rc^2$
- Constrains: How $\mathcal{T}$ affects the momentum/direction components of $F_{\mu\nu}$

**2. Gravitational Redshift** (G changes EM energy):
- Frequency shift: $f_{obs}/f_{emit} = \sqrt{g_{00}(emit)/g_{00}(obs)}$
- Constrains: How $\mathcal{T}$ affects the energy/frequency components of $F_{\mu\nu}$

**3. Black Hole Absorption** (G fully absorbs EM at threshold):
- At horizon: $g_{00} \to 0$, transformation becomes total
- Constrains: The asymptotic behavior of $\mathcal{T}$ at extreme curvature

**Deduction program**: From these three observational classes, the form of $\mathcal{T}$ can be constrained. The transformation must:
- Reduce to identity in flat spacetime: $\mathcal{T}[R=0] = \mathbb{1}$
- Reproduce standard lensing angles
- Reproduce standard redshift formula  
- Diverge appropriately at horizons

**Observer locality**: Each observer receives the EM field in their local frame. The transformation G→EM is **local** at each propagation step—there is no global "energy loss," only a series of local transactions. This is fully consistent with the observer-dependence of energy in GR while adding that the local transformation encodes information transfer.

### 9B.2C Connection to the Tensor Extension of Noether's Theorem

The G→EM interaction fits within the broader framework of tensor conservation laws on the discrete Planck lattice Λ = ℓ_P · ℤ⁴:

$\partial_\mu J^\mu_I = 0 \quad \text{(Information current)}$
$\partial_\mu T^{\mu\nu} = 0 \quad \text{(Energy-momentum tensor)}$
$\partial_\mu j^\mu_{em} = 0 \quad \text{(Charge current)}$
$D_\mu j^\mu_a = 0 \quad \text{(Color current)}$

All four conservation laws are **projections** of the master information conservation onto specific sectors of Ω (see Main Paper §8, unified-theory-diagram Level 8).

**The G→EM transformation respects all conservation laws simultaneously**:
- Information is conserved (photon gains witness information as it loses spectral sharpness)
- Energy-momentum is locally conserved (transformation is covariant)
- Charge is conserved (photon remains neutral)

The transformation $\mathcal{T}$ must be derived such that it respects all tensor conservation laws. This is a strong constraint that will guide the formal derivation in Appendix EMG.

*Future formalization*: The precise tensor transformation equations—how $R_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}$ acts on $F_{\mu\nu}$—require rigorous derivation from information-theoretic principles. This will be developed in Appendix EMG following Lean formalization of the core gravitational framework. The foundation (G-G interactions, healing flow) must be established before introducing the EM actor.

### 9B.3 Gravitational Redshift as Information Transformation

**Theorem 9B.1** (Information Conservation for Photons): For a photon propagating along a null geodesic through a stationary gravitational field, total information is conserved:

$\frac{dI_{\text{photon}}}{d\lambda} = 0$

where λ is the affine parameter along the geodesic.

*Proof*:

**Step 1**: The photon frequency transforms as:
$\frac{f_2}{f_1} = \sqrt{\frac{g_{00}(r_1)}{g_{00}(r_2)}} = \sqrt{\frac{1 - 2GM/r_1 c^2}{1 - 2GM/r_2 c^2}}$

**Step 2**: The spectral width Δf transforms identically (same gravitational factor):
$\frac{\Delta f_2}{\Delta f_1} = \frac{f_2}{f_1}$

**Step 3**: Therefore the spectral information:
$I_{\text{spectral}} = \log_2\left(\frac{f}{\Delta f}\right) = \text{invariant}$

**Step 4**: Phase information transforms covariantly—the total accumulated phase:
$\phi = \int k_\mu dx^\mu$
is a scalar invariant along the geodesic.

**Step 5**: Polarization is parallel-transported along the geodesic, preserving I_polarization.

**Step 6**: Total information $I_{\text{photon}} = I_{\text{spectral}} + I_{\text{phase}} + I_{\text{polarization}}$ is conserved. □

### 9B.4 Redshift as Geometric Witness

**Key Insight**: The gravitational redshift Δf/f is not "lost energy"—it is **encoded information** about the geometry through which the photon passed.

**Definition 9B.2** (Geometric Witness Information): A photon emerging from a gravitational field carries witness information:

$I_{\text{witness}} = \log_2\left(\frac{f_1}{f_2}\right) = \log_2\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 2GM/rc^2}}\right)$

This encodes:
- The mass M of the gravitating source
- The emission radius r
- The integrated gravitational potential along the path

**Theorem 9B.2** (Information Budget Conservation): The total information budget satisfies:

$I_{\text{spectral}}^{\text{observed}} + I_{\text{witness}} = I_{\text{spectral}}^{\text{emitted}}$

*Interpretation*: The photon "trades" spectral sharpness for geometric witness information. The information is not lost—it is transformed from one channel to another.

### 9B.5 Comparison: Massive vs. Massless Propagation

| Property | Massive Particle | Photon |
|----------|-----------------|--------|
| Bound information | $I_{\text{bound}} = mc^2/(k_B T \ln 2)$ | $I_{\text{bound}} = 0$ |
| Reshaping cost | $E_{\text{reshape}} = mc^2 \cdot f(R,\pi,e,\sqrt{2})$ | $E_{\text{reshape}} = 0$ |
| Creates defects | Yes (δ(π,e,√2) truncation errors) | No |
| Emits gravitons | Yes (above threshold) | No |
| Participates in healing | Active participant | Passive witness |
| Gravitational interaction | Creates + responds to curvature | Only responds to curvature |
| Energy in gravity | Real exchange (kinetic ↔ potential) | Coordinate transformation |

### 9B.6 Resolution of the "Lost Energy" Question

**Classical puzzle**: "Where does the photon's energy go when it redshifts?"

**Framework resolution**: The question is malformed. Energy is not a scalar in curved spacetime—it is observer-dependent. What IS invariant is information.

The photon's information content remains constant:

$I_{\text{photon}}^{\text{source}} = I_{\text{photon}}^{\text{observer}}$

The apparent "energy loss" is a coordinate artifact. The real physical content—information—is conserved exactly as required by the fourth Noether law.

**Analogy**: A letter passing through customs receives stamps at each border. The letter doesn't "lose weight" at borders—it gains information about its journey. Similarly, a photon's redshift is a "stamp" recording its passage through curved geometry.

### 9B.7 Virtual Gravitons and Photon Propagation

From §3.1 (Virtual Gravitons), the static gravitational field around a mass is maintained by virtual graviton standing waves:

$R_{\text{virtual}}(n) = A \exp\left(-\frac{|n - n_{\text{source}}|}{\xi}\right)$

**Proposition 9B.2** (Photon-Virtual Graviton Non-Interaction): Photons propagate through the virtual graviton field without absorption or emission.

*Argument*:

1. Virtual gravitons represent continuous local repair around masses (§3.1)
2. Photons carry no bound information requiring repair
3. Therefore photons do not couple to the healing mechanism
4. Photons follow null geodesics determined by the healed geometry g_μν
5. The photon "sees" the result of healing, not the healing process itself

**Physical picture**: Massive objects create geometric strain requiring constant repair (virtual gravitons). Photons travel through the already-repaired geometry, experiencing its curvature but not participating in its maintenance.

### 9B.8 Observational Implications

**Prediction 9B.1** (Redshift as Complete Geometric Record): A photon's gravitational redshift contains sufficient information to reconstruct the integrated gravitational potential along its path:

$\Phi_{\text{integrated}} = \int_{\text{path}} \Gamma^0_{0\mu} dx^\mu = -\frac{c^2}{2}\ln\left(\frac{f_{\text{obs}}}{f_{\text{emit}}}\right)^2$

**Prediction 9B.2** (Information Preservation Through Absorption): When a redshifted photon is absorbed, its witness information must be transferred to the absorber:

$I_{\text{witness}} \rightarrow I_{\text{absorber}}$

This is required by the fourth Noether law—information cannot be destroyed.

**Prediction 9B.3** (No Graviton Emission from Light Beams): Even intense electromagnetic fields (laser beams, gamma-ray bursts) should not emit gravitons directly, only through their coupling to massive matter. This distinguishes our framework from theories where T_μν^EM directly sources graviton production.

### 9B.9 Connection to Hawking Radiation

At black hole horizons, the situation changes qualitatively:

1. **Infalling photons**: Approach the horizon, experiencing extreme blueshift
2. **Information accumulation**: The witness information diverges as r → r_s
3. **Horizon behavior**: The fourth Noether law requires this information to be preserved
4. **Hawking radiation**: May carry the accumulated witness information of infalling photons

**Conjecture 9B.1** (Information Recovery via Hawking Radiation): The gravitational witness information of photons absorbed by a black hole is encoded in correlations within Hawking radiation, consistent with §5.1.

### 9B.10 Summary: Photons in the Information Framework

The gravitational redshift of photons is reinterpreted within the fourth Noether law framework:

| Classical View | Information Framework View |
|----------------|---------------------------|
| Photon "loses energy" | Photon transforms information channels |
| Energy goes "into the field" | Information is conserved exactly |
| Redshift is energy transfer | Redshift is geometric encoding |
| T_μν^EM sources gravity | Photons witness, not create, healing |
| "Where did energy go?" | Energy is coordinate-dependent; information is invariant |

**Central result**: Photons are **information witnesses**, not **information storers**. They record the geometry they traverse without participating in its maintenance. The fourth Noether law ensures this witness information is never lost—it is the conserved quantity, not the coordinate-dependent energy.

This resolves the apparent paradox of gravitational redshift: no energy is "lost" because information—the true conserved quantity—is preserved exactly.

## 10. Discussion

### 10.1 Ontological Implications

The framework suggests:
- Reality consists fundamentally of information flow patterns
- Particles represent stable information vortices
- Forces arise from information gradients
- Spacetime provides the information flow geometry

### 10.2 Falsifiability

The framework makes specific predictions:
1. Acceleration-dependent quantum error rates
2. Gravitational decoherence scaling with GM/rc²
3. Holographic bound as throughput rather than storage limit
4. Information conservation emergence at macroscale

Violation of these predictions would require revision of the framework.

### 10.3 Open Questions

1. Complete derivation of information-gravity coupling constant
2. Role of information flow in cosmological evolution
3. Connection to quantum entanglement structure
4. Information content of gravitational degrees of freedom

## 11. Conclusion

We have identified a fourth fundamental conservation law arising from uniform reshaping invariance:

**The Fourth Noether Law: Conservation of Information**
$\frac{dI_{\text{universe}}}{dt} = 0 \quad \text{(globally)}$

### 11.1 Fundamental Status

This law holds the same universal status as energy, momentum, and charge conservation:

| Conservation Law | Symmetry | Status |
|------------------|----------|--------|
| Energy | Time translation | Universal postulate |
| Momentum | Space translation | Universal postulate |
| Angular momentum | Rotation | Universal postulate |
| Charge | U(1) gauge | Universal postulate |
| **Information** | **Uniform reshaping** | **Universal postulate** |

The law applies to all physics: nuclear explosions, radio waves, gravitational dynamics, quantum entanglement, throwing a rock. It is a **postulate of Ω**—the algebraic foundation underlying reality.

### 11.2 Application to Geometry

In this paper, we applied the universal law to 4D spacetime geometry. The consequences:

1. **Geometric defects must heal** (information cannot vanish in holes)
2. **Healing requires carriers**: gravitons emerge as repair mechanism
3. **Gravity as information gradient**: $\vec{g} = -(c^4/8\pi G)\nabla I$
4. **Black hole information paradox resolved**: information conserved, not destroyed
5. **Holographic bound derived**: maximum information throughput, not storage
6. **Gravitational redshift reinterpreted**: photons do not "lose energy" but encode geometric witness information—the redshift records the spacetime geometry traversed

### 11.3 The Deeper Picture

The algebraic structure Ω is geometric in n > 4 dimensions. Observable 4D spacetime is one projection. The fourth Noether law operates at the level of Ω, manifesting differently in each projection:

- In 4D geometry: graviton-mediated healing
- In D_ent: entanglement adjacency (Appendix E)  
- In U(1): electromagnetic phase coherence
- In matter: mechanical information transfer

**The law is singular and fundamental. The applications are many.**

### 11.4 Final Statement

Information—rather than energy or matter—may constitute the most fundamental conserved quantity in physics. Energy, mass, and forces represent different aspects of information dynamics within the multi-dimensional geometry of Ω.

The universe is not made of information—it is made of physical objects: particles, fields, geometry. But these objects **carry** information, as a parameter, as a property. Just as an electron is not charge but *has* charge, the universe is not information but *carries* information.

**The universe conserves the information it carries.**
