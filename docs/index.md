# **Ω-Theory**
## Discrete Spacetime and Mass as Geometric Reshaping

$$\boxed{\Lambda = \ell_P \cdot \mathbb{Z}^4 \implies \text{Everything}}$$

*A unified physics framework where everything derives from one postulate:*
**spacetime is discrete at the Planck scale.**

## The Central Question

!!! quote "How It All Started"

    *"What if everything wants to teleport at the speed of light—but we can't, because we have mass, and need to expend energy to reshape the geometry around us?"*

    This simple question started it all.

## One Postulate, Everything Follows

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-atom:{ .lg .middle } **Spacetime is Discrete**

    ---

    The universe is a 4D integer lattice at Planck scale: $\Lambda = \ell_P \cdot \mathbb{Z}^4$

    All physics emerges from Planck-scale jumps.

-   :material-run-fast:{ .lg .middle } **All Particles Want Speed *c***

    ---

    Every particle attempts to propagate at the speed of light.

    **Mass is what you pay when you can't.**

-   :material-math-integral:{ .lg .middle } **Irrationals Create Uncertainty**

    ---

    $\pi, e, \sqrt{2}$ cannot be computed exactly in finite time.

    Action thresholds $S = n\hbar$ force quantum transitions.

-   :material-shield-lock:{ .lg .middle } **Information is Conserved**

    ---

    The Fourth Noether Law: $\partial_\mu J^\mu_I = 0$

    Chronology protection is automatic—time travel impossible.

## Key Equations

| Equation | Meaning |
|:---------|:--------|
| $\Lambda = \ell_P \cdot \mathbb{Z}^4$ | Discrete spacetime lattice |
| $d_{\text{eff}}(E) = 4 - 2E/E_P$ | Dimensional flow (CDT confirmed) |
| $\partial_\mu J^\mu_I = 0$ | Information conservation (Fourth Law) |
| $\rho_S = NkT/V$ | Action density (three variables!) |
| $F(T) = F_0/(1 + \alpha T)$ | Gate fidelity (Diraq 2024 confirmed) |

---

## Experimentally Validated

!!! success "Confirmed Predictions"

    | Prediction | Status |
    |:-----------|:-------|
    | $F(T) = F_0/(1 + \alpha T)$ linear scaling | **:material-check: Diraq 2024** |
    | Power-law $T^{-2.5}$ not Arrhenius | **:material-check: Confirmed** |
    | No 4th generation fermions | Consistent |
    | CPT exactly conserved | Consistent ($10^{-18}$) |

!!! warning "Falsification Criteria"

    - Non-linear $F(T)$ observed
    - Exponential temperature dependence
    - Any 4th generation fermion discovery
    - Any closed timelike curve observation

## Formal Verification in Lean 4

!!! info "Machine-Verified Proofs"

    Unlike typical physics papers, Omega-Theory includes **10,000+ lines of machine-verified Lean 4 proofs**.

    **Proven theorems include:**

    - $E_P = m_P \times c^2$ (Planck energy-mass relation)
    - Christoffel symmetry: $\Gamma^i_{jk} = \Gamma^i_{kj}$
    - Metric compatibility: $\nabla_\mu g_{\nu\rho} = 0$
    - **Fourth Noether Law** (information conservation)
