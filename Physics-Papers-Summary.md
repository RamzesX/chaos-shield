# Physics Papers Summary: Discrete Spacetime and the Nature of Reality

## Overview

This collection presents a revolutionary framework for understanding the fundamental nature of reality, proposing that spacetime is discrete at the Planck scale and that mass emerges from geometric reshaping costs during quantum propagation. The theory unifies quantum mechanics and general relativity while explaining numerous physics mysteries through elegant geometric principles.

## Core Revolutionary Ideas

### 1. **Discrete Spacetime**
- Space and time are quantized at the Planck scale (10^-35 m, 10^-44 s)
- Reality consists of a discrete lattice, not a continuous manifold
- All particles fundamentally "jump" between discrete points

### 2. **Mass from Geometric Reshaping**
- All particles attempt to move at speed c through quantum jumps
- Massive particles must "reshape" local spacetime geometry with each jump
- This reshaping requires energy, explaining why massive particles move slower than c
- E = mc² emerges naturally from this geometric principle

### 3. **Fundamental Uncertainty from Irrational Numbers**
- π, e, and √2 remain irrational even at the Planck scale
- These values cannot be computed exactly, creating irreducible uncertainty
- This provides a deeper foundation for quantum uncertainty beyond Heisenberg

### 4. **Observer Blindness**
- Discrete observers cannot directly perceive their own discreteness
- This explains why we perceive continuous spacetime despite discrete reality
- Resolves the paradox of why continuous mathematics works so well in physics

### 5. **Information as Fundamental**
- Information flow is more fundamental than energy
- Gravity emerges from information flow disruption
- The universe "computes itself" through discrete updates
