## What is this?

**Chaos Shield** explores what happens when we take computability seriously as the foundation of mathematics and physics. The project contains original research on:

- **Conv(‚Ñö)**: Mathematics using only rational numbers and convergent sequences
- **Discrete Spacetime**: Quantum gravity through geometric reshaping at the Planck scale
- **Quantum Chaos Protocols**: Post-quantum security via economic exhaustion
- **Unix/OS Internals**: Deep dives into how systems actually work

## Key Ideas

1. **All particles want to travel at light speed** - Mass is just the energy cost of reshaping spacetime
2. **Real numbers don't exist** - Everything computable uses rationals anyway
3. **Make attacks too expensive** - Generate 10‚Å∂ fake operations per real one
4. **The universe is discrete** - Spacetime is a lattice at 10‚Åª¬≥‚Åµ meters
