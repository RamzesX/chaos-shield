# Chaos Shield: Ω-Theory 🛡️

> *"What if everything wants to teleport at the speed of light—but we can't, because we have mass, and need to expend energy to reshape the geometry around us?"*

This simple question started it all.

## What is Ω-Theory?

A unified physics framework where:

- **Mass = reshaping cost** — Particles pay energy to reshape local geometry at each Planck-scale jump
- **Quantum uncertainty = truncated irrationals** — π, e, √2 can't be computed before action thresholds force transitions
- **Entanglement = unstable wormholes** — D_ent connections collapse upon measurement (Lyapunov instability)
- **Black holes = hungry wormholes** — Devastating because they self-feed on mass
- **Time travel = impossible** — CTCs violate information conservation (fourth Noether law)

**One question. One answer. Everything follows.**

## Key Ideas

| Insight | Consequence |
|---------|-------------|
| Spacetime is discrete (ℓ_P lattice) | All physics emerges from Planck-scale jumps |
| All particles want to move at c | Mass is what you pay when you can't |
| Action accumulates to S = nℏ | Computational deadlines create quantum uncertainty |
| Information is conserved (∂_μJ^μ_I = 0) | Fourth Noether law; chronology protection automatic |
| Entanglement wormholes are unstable | Measurement triggers collapse; no-signaling explained |
| Safe wormholes need external energy | Unlike black holes (self-feeding), engineered wormholes require maintenance |

## Quick Start

### The Genesis Story
Start with [`PhysicsPapers/Main-Paper-Postulates.md`](PhysicsPapers/Main-Paper-Postulates.md) — includes "How This Started"

### Core Mechanism
[`PhysicsPapers/KeyInsight-Irrationals-Action-Thresholds.md`](PhysicsPapers/KeyInsight-Irrationals-Action-Thresholds.md) — How π, e, √2 create quantum uncertainty

### Practical Applications
[`PhysicsPapers/Appendix-B-Quantum-Computing-Temperature-Limits.md`](PhysicsPapers/Appendix-B-Quantum-Computing-Temperature-Limits.md) — $1.4B industry impact potential

### NEW: Stable Wormholes
[`PhysicsPapers/Appendix-S-Stable-Wormholes-And-Chronology-Protection.md`](PhysicsPapers/Appendix-S-Stable-Wormholes-And-Chronology-Protection.md) — Three-tier classification, time paradox prevention

## Testable Predictions

| Prediction | Status | How to Test |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| F(T) = F₀/(1 + αT) linear scaling | ✓ Diraq 2024 data matches | Quantum computers |
| Power-law T^(-2.5) not Arrhenius | ✓ Confirmed | Temperature sweeps |
| Entanglement fidelity F_ent(T) | Testable | Ion traps, superconducting qubits |
| No time travel possible | Consistent | Any CTC observation would falsify |

**Philosophy**: Good science should be **FUN**, **FALSIFIABLE**, and **USEFUL**.
