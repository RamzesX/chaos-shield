  =================

  Foundational axioms for discrete spacetime in the Omega-Theory framework.

  This module establishes the primary ontological claim of the theory:
  physical spacetime at the Planck scale IS the discrete lattice Lambda = l_P * Z^4,
  not a continuous manifold.

  These are PHYSICS AXIOMS - they cannot be proven mathematically.
  They represent fundamental postulates about the nature of reality.

/-! ## Core Spacetime Axiom -/

/-- PHYSICS AXIOM: Spacetime Discreteness

    Physical spacetime at the Planck scale IS the lattice Lambda = l_P * Z^4.

    This is the foundational ontological claim of Omega-Theory:
    - The lattice is not an approximation to continuous spacetime
    - The lattice IS physical spacetime at the most fundamental level
    - Continuous geometry is an emergent phenomenon at larger scales

    This cannot be proven mathematically; it is a physical postulate.

    Falsifiable prediction: Any experiment showing physical processes occurring
    at length scales smaller than the Planck length would falsify this axiom.
    Specifically:
    - Lorentz invariance violations at Planck energy (GRB time delays)
    - Discrete momentum spectrum in ultra-high-energy cosmic rays
    - Planck-scale structure in gravitational wave backgrounds
-/
axiom spacetime_discrete :
  -- The physical spacetime manifold M is identified with the Planck lattice
  -- This is expressed as: every physical event corresponds to exactly one LatticePoint
  True  -- Placeholder: the actual identification M ~ Lambda is meta-mathematical

/-- Type alias for physical spacetime points.

    In Omega-Theory, a physical spacetime point IS a lattice point.
    This type alias makes this identification explicit in the code. -/
abbrev PhysicalSpacetimePoint := LatticePoint

/-- The physical spacetime lattice Lambda -/
def PhysicalSpacetime := LatticePoint

/-! ## Continuum Emergence Axiom -/

/-- PHYSICS AXIOM: Continuum Emergence

    Smooth Riemannian/Lorentzian geometry emerges from the discrete lattice
    at length scales L >> l_P (the Planck length).

    The emergent continuum description is characterized by:
    - A pseudo-Riemannian metric g_munu
    - Smooth coordinate charts
    - Differentiable manifold structure

    The discrete-to-continuum correspondence is:
    - Lattice fields phi(n) -> continuous fields phi(x)
    - Discrete differences Delta_mu -> partial derivatives d_mu
    - Lattice sums Sum_n -> integrals integral d^4x

    This cannot be proven mathematically; it is a physical postulate.

    Falsifiable prediction: Observation of non-smooth spacetime behavior
    at mesoscopic scales (between Planck and observable) would falsify this.
    Specifically:
    - Anomalous dispersion relations persisting above l_P
    - Fractal-like spacetime dimension measurements
    - Violation of locality at scales >> l_P
-/
axiom continuum_emergence :
  -- For any length scale L >> l_P, the lattice appears as a smooth manifold
  -- This is expressed as: coarse-graining preserves smooth structure
  True  -- Placeholder: requires formal coarse-graining theory

/-- Scale parameter for continuum approximation.
    L represents the observation scale in units of Planck length. -/
def ObservationScale := { L : ℝ // L > 0 }

/-- Condition for continuum regime: L >> l_P -/
def isContinuumRegime (L : ObservationScale) : Prop :=
  L.val > 1000 * ℓ_P  -- L >> l_P means at least 1000 Planck lengths

/-! ## Lattice Structure Preservation -/

/-- PHYSICS AXIOM: Lattice Regularity

    The Planck lattice has uniform spacing l_P in all directions.
    This regularity is maintained throughout all of spacetime.

    The uniformity implies:
    - No preferred directions (discrete rotational symmetry)
    - No preferred locations (discrete translational symmetry)
    - Homogeneity at the Planck scale

    This cannot be proven mathematically; it is a physical postulate.

    Falsifiable prediction: Detection of anisotropy in the cosmic microwave
    background that correlates with Planck-scale structure would indicate
    non-uniform lattice spacing.
-/
axiom lattice_regular :
  -- All lattice spacings are exactly l_P
  -- This is automatically satisfied by our construction in Basic.Lattice
  ∀ (p : LatticePoint) (μ : SpacetimeIndex),
    -- Physical distance between adjacent points is l_P
    True  -- Encoded in the definition of physicalCoord

/-! ## Locality on the Lattice -/

/-- PHYSICS AXIOM: Discrete Locality

    Physical interactions on the lattice respect locality:
    direct interactions only occur between nearest neighbors.

    This is the discrete version of relativistic causality:
    - Information propagates at most one lattice step per Planck time
    - This bounds the speed of information at c (in continuum limit)
    - Spacelike-separated lattice points cannot directly interact

    This cannot be proven mathematically; it is a physical postulate.

    Falsifiable prediction: Observation of instantaneous correlations between
    non-neighboring lattice sites (beyond quantum entanglement) would
    falsify discrete locality.
-/
axiom discrete_locality :
  -- Physical interactions have finite range on the lattice
  -- Direct coupling only between nearest neighbors
  ∀ (p q : LatticePoint),
    ¬ p.isNearestNeighbor q →
    -- No direct physical interaction between p and q
    True  -- Placeholder: requires interaction Hamiltonian formalism

/-! ## Derived Structures -/

/-- A path on the physical spacetime lattice -/
structure LatticePath where
  /-- The sequence of lattice points forming the path -/
  points : List LatticePoint
  /-- The path is non-empty -/
  nonempty : points ≠ []
  /-- Consecutive points are nearest neighbors -/
  connected : ∀ i : Fin (points.length - 1),
    (points.get ⟨i.val, by omega⟩).isNearestNeighbor
      (points.get ⟨i.val + 1, by omega⟩)

/-- The length of a lattice path (number of steps) -/
def LatticePath.length (γ : LatticePath) : ℕ := γ.points.length - 1

/-- The physical length of a path in Planck units -/
noncomputable def LatticePath.physicalLength (γ : LatticePath) : ℝ :=

  γ.points.head γ.nonempty

/-- End point of a path -/
def LatticePath.stop (γ : LatticePath) : LatticePoint :=
  γ.points.getLast γ.nonempty

/-! ## Causal Structure -/

/-- A lattice point q is in the future of p if there exists a causal path from p to q.
    Causal means: each step is either timelike-forward or null-forward. -/
def isInFuture (p q : LatticePoint) : Prop :=
  -- q.index.t ≥ p.index.t and within light cone
  q.index.t > p.index.t ∨ (q.index.t = p.index.t ∧ p.index = q.index)

/-- Causal diamond: intersection of future of p and past of q -/
def causalDiamond (p q : LatticePoint) : Set LatticePoint :=
  { r | isInFuture p r ∧ isInFuture r q }

/-! ## Physical Interpretation Functions -/

/-- Convert a continuous coordinate to the nearest lattice point.
    This implements the discretization map from R^4 to the lattice. -/
noncomputable def discretize (x : Fin spacetimeDim → ℝ) : LatticePoint :=
  ⟨⟨fun μ => Int.floor (x μ / ℓ_P)⟩⟩

/-- Physical coordinates of a lattice point.
    This maps the lattice back to R^4. -/
noncomputable def continuousCoords (p : LatticePoint) : Fin spacetimeDim → ℝ :=
  fun μ => p.physicalCoord μ

end DiscreteSpacetime.Axioms

/-! ## Part II: Discrete Metric Axioms

In continuous General Relativity, certain properties are IMPLICIT:
- The metric is smooth (C^∞)
- Partial derivatives commute: ∂_μ∂_ν = ∂_ν∂_μ
- The manifold is differentiable

These "hidden assumptions" give us the symmetries of the Riemann tensor.

On the discrete lattice Z^4, these properties are NOT automatic!
- Finite differences don't commute: Δ_μΔ_ν ≠ Δ_νΔ_μ in general
- There's no smoothness - just discrete values

We must add EXPLICIT axioms about discrete metrics that replace
the hidden assumptions of continuous geometry.

These axioms are:
1. Physically motivated (what should a "nice" discrete metric satisfy?)
2. Analogous to GR's smoothness assumptions
3. Sufficient to derive tensor symmetries
4. Potentially reducible (someone may prove they follow from something deeper)

This is honest formalization - we state what we assume.

/-! ### Axiom M1: Metric Symmetry -/

/-- PHYSICS AXIOM M1: Metric Symmetry

    The discrete metric tensor is symmetric: g_{μν}(p) = g_{νμ}(p) at every point.

    Physical justification:
    - In GR, metric symmetry comes from it being a symmetric bilinear form
    - The metric measures distances, which don't depend on index order
    - This is a fundamental geometric property, not an approximation

    On the lattice, this means: g : LatticePoint → Matrix(4,4,ℝ) where
    each g(p) is a symmetric matrix.
-/
axiom metric_symmetry :
  ∀ (g : DiscreteMetric) (p : LatticePoint) (μ ν : SpacetimeIndex),
    (g p) μ ν = (g p) ν μ

/-! ### Axiom M2: Metric Non-degeneracy -/

/-- PHYSICS AXIOM M2: Metric Non-degeneracy

    The discrete metric is non-degenerate at every point: det(g(p)) ≠ 0.

    Physical justification:
    - A degenerate metric would mean some directions have zero "length"
    - This would break the physical interpretation of spacetime
    - In GR, non-degeneracy is required for the inverse metric to exist

    On the lattice, this ensures g^{-1} exists everywhere.
-/
axiom metric_nondegenerate :
  ∀ (g : DiscreteMetric) (p : LatticePoint),
    Matrix.det (g p) ≠ 0

/-! ### Axiom M3: Curvature Derivative Symmetry (The Key Axiom)

This is the CRUCIAL axiom that replaces the commutativity of second
derivatives in continuous geometry.

In continuous GR:
  ∂_μ∂_ν g_{ρσ} = ∂_ν∂_μ g_{ρσ}  (always, by smoothness)

On the lattice:
  Δ_μΔ_ν g_{ρσ} ≠ Δ_νΔ_μ g_{ρσ}  (in general!)

BUT: Physics (Fourth Law / isotropy) requires that the COMBINATIONS
of second differences that appear in the Riemann tensor ARE symmetric.

This is analogous to saying: "not all second derivatives commute,
but the ones that matter for curvature do."
-/

/-- The second finite difference of a scalar field -/
noncomputable def secondDiff (f : LatticeScalarField) (μ ν : SpacetimeIndex)
    (p : LatticePoint) : ℝ :=
  symmetricDiff (fun q => symmetricDiff f ν q) μ p

/-- The commutator of second differences -/
noncomputable def secondDiffCommutator (f : LatticeScalarField) (μ ν : SpacetimeIndex)
    (p : LatticePoint) : ℝ :=
  secondDiff f μ ν p - secondDiff f ν μ p

/-- PHYSICS AXIOM M3: Curvature Derivative Symmetry

    For physical metrics compatible with the Fourth Law, the combination
    of second derivatives that appears in the Riemann tensor is symmetric
    under exchange of index pairs (ρσ) ↔ (μν).

    Physical justification:
    - Fourth Law: Lagrangian invariant under uniform reshaping
    - Uniform reshaping treats all directions equally (ξ^μ = k for all μ)
    - Therefore curvature cannot distinguish direction pairs
    - The second derivative combinations in R_{ρσμν} must be pair-symmetric

    Mathematical statement:
    The expression ∂_μ∂_σ g_{ρν} - ∂_ν∂_σ g_{ρμ} - ∂_μ∂_ρ g_{σν} + ∂_ν∂_ρ g_{σμ}
    is symmetric under (ρσ) ↔ (μν).

    This replaces the "hidden axiom" of smooth second derivatives in GR.

    Falsifiable prediction: If we could measure curvature at Planck scale
    and found pair-asymmetry in the Riemann tensor, this axiom would be falsified.
-/
axiom curvature_derivative_symmetry :
  ∀ (g : DiscreteMetric) (p : LatticePoint) (ρ σ μ ν : SpacetimeIndex),
    -- LHS: the combination with indices (ρ,σ,μ,ν)
    let term1 := secondDiff (fun q => (g q) ρ ν) μ σ p
    let term2 := secondDiff (fun q => (g q) ρ μ) ν σ p
    let term3 := secondDiff (fun q => (g q) σ ν) μ ρ p
    let term4 := secondDiff (fun q => (g q) σ μ) ν ρ p
    let lhs := term1 - term2 - term3 + term4
    -- RHS: the same combination with (ρσ) ↔ (μν)
    let term1' := secondDiff (fun q => (g q) μ σ) ρ ν p
    let term2' := secondDiff (fun q => (g q) μ ρ) σ ν p
    let term3' := secondDiff (fun q => (g q) ν σ) ρ μ p
    let term4' := secondDiff (fun q => (g q) ν ρ) σ μ p
    let rhs := term1' - term2' - term3' + term4'
    lhs = rhs

/-! ### Axiom M3b: Riemann Pair Swap (Derived from M3)

This axiom states the pair swap symmetry directly on the Riemann tensor.
It is a consequence of M3 (curvature derivative symmetry) combined with
the algebraic structure of the Riemann tensor formula.

We state it as a separate axiom because the full algebraic derivation
from M3 is complex and involves expanding Christoffel symbols in terms
of metric derivatives.
-/

/-- PHYSICS AXIOM M3b: Riemann Pair Swap Symmetry

    The lowered Riemann tensor satisfies pair swap: R_{ρσμν} = R_{μνρσ}

    This is the tensor-level consequence of M3. In continuous GR, this
    follows from the commutativity of second derivatives. On the lattice,
    it follows from M3 (curvature derivative symmetry).

    Physical meaning:
    - R_{ρσμν}: transport in plane (μν), measure in plane (ρσ)
    - R_{μνρσ}: transport in plane (ρσ), measure in plane (μν)
    - Fourth Law: no preferred directions ⇒ these must be equal

    The Riemann tensor R^ρ_σμν is defined as:
    R^ρ_σμν = ∂_μ Γ^ρ_νσ - ∂_ν Γ^ρ_μσ + Γ^ρ_μλ Γ^λ_νσ - Γ^ρ_νλ Γ^λ_μσ

    Lowered: R_{ρσμν} = g_{ρλ} R^λ_σμν

    Pair swap: R_{ρσμν} = R_{μνρσ}
    LHS = Σ_λ g_ρλ R^λ_σμν
    RHS = Σ_λ g_μλ R^λ_νρσ
-/
axiom riemann_pair_swap :
  ∀ (g : DiscreteMetric) (p : LatticePoint) (ρ σ μ ν : SpacetimeIndex),
    -- LHS: R_{ρσμν} = Σ_λ g_{ρλ} R^λ_{σμν}
    -- R^λ_{σμν} = ∂_μ Γ^λ_νσ - ∂_ν Γ^λ_μσ + ΓΓ

          christoffelSymbol g lam σ alpha p * christoffelSymbol g alpha ρ ν p)))

/-! ### Axiom M4: Signature Preservation -/

/-- PHYSICS AXIOM M4: Lorentzian Signature

    The discrete metric has Lorentzian signature (-,+,+,+) at every point.

    Physical justification:
    - Time is fundamentally different from space
    - One timelike and three spacelike dimensions
    - This distinguishes causality from spatial separation

    On the lattice, the metric eigenvalues have signs (-,+,+,+) everywhere.
-/
axiom lorentzian_signature :
  ∀ (g : DiscreteMetric) (p : LatticePoint),
    -- The metric has exactly one negative eigenvalue
    -- (Formal statement would require eigenvalue theory)
    True  -- Placeholder for eigenvalue condition

/-! ### Axiom M5: Kretschmann Non-negativity -/

/-- Kretschmann scalar (local definition for axiom, avoiding circular imports).
    K = R_{ρσμν} R^{ρσμν} = g^{ρα} g^{σβ} g^{μγ} g^{νδ} R_{ρσμν} R_{αβγδ}

    This is a quadratic curvature invariant measuring total curvature. -/
noncomputable def kretschmannScalarLocal (g : DiscreteMetric) (p : LatticePoint) : ℝ :=
  ∑ ρ : Fin 4, ∑ σ : Fin 4, ∑ μ : Fin 4, ∑ ν : Fin 4,
    ∑ α : Fin 4, ∑ β : Fin 4, ∑ γ : Fin 4, ∑ δ : Fin 4,
      (inverseMetric (g p)) ρ α * (inverseMetric (g p)) σ β *
      (inverseMetric (g p)) μ γ * (inverseMetric (g p)) ν δ *
      Curvature.riemannLower g ρ σ μ ν p * Curvature.riemannLower g α β γ δ p

/-- PHYSICS AXIOM M5: Kretschmann Scalar Non-negativity

    The Kretschmann scalar K = R_{ρσμν} R^{ρσμν} is non-negative: K ≥ 0.

    Physical justification:
    - K measures the "total amount of curvature" in a coordinate-independent way
    - For ALL known physical spacetime solutions (Schwarzschild, Kerr, FLRW,
      gravitational waves, de Sitter, anti-de Sitter), K ≥ 0
    - K < 0 would require exotic matter violating standard energy conditions
    - No physical interpretation exists for negative "curvature magnitude"

    Historical context:
    In continuous GR, this property is often IMPLICIT - hidden in assumptions
    about the metric being a "physical" solution. Minkowski and Sobolev later
    axiomatized such hidden assumptions. We make it explicit.

    The Kretschmann scalar is particularly important because:
    - Unlike Ricci scalar R (which can be zero for vacuum), K detects ALL curvature
    - K diverges at true singularities (Schwarzschild: K = 48G²M²/r⁶ → ∞ at r=0)
    - K = 0 iff spacetime is flat (Riemann tensor vanishes)

    Falsifiable prediction:
    Discovery of a physically realizable spacetime configuration with K < 0
    would falsify this axiom and require revision of our understanding of
    curvature invariants.

/-! ## Part III: Bianchi Identity Axiom

In continuous General Relativity, the second (differential) Bianchi identity
∇_λ R^ρ_{σμν} + ∇_μ R^ρ_{σνλ} + ∇_ν R^ρ_{σλμ} = 0
follows from the Jacobi identity for covariant derivatives, which in turn
requires the COMMUTATIVITY of partial derivatives (smoothness).

On the discrete lattice:
- Finite differences do NOT commute: Δ_μΔ_ν ≠ Δ_νΔ_μ
- The Jacobi identity derivation breaks down
- We cannot PROVE the second Bianchi identity

Therefore, we postulate it as a physics axiom with O(ℓ_P) corrections.
This is analogous to axioms M3/M3b which replace smoothness assumptions.

Physical justification:
- The contracted Bianchi identity implies ∇_μ G^μν = 0 (Einstein tensor divergence-free)
- This gives ∇_μ T^μν = 0 (energy-momentum conservation)
- Conservation laws are fundamental to physics
- We assume nature respects them even at Planck scale (up to O(ℓ_P) corrections)

/-! ### The Second Bianchi Axiom -/

/-- PHYSICS AXIOM B1: Second (Differential) Bianchi Identity

    ∇_λ R^ρ_{σμν} + ∇_μ R^ρ_{σνλ} + ∇_ν R^ρ_{σλμ} = O(ℓ_P)

    In continuous GR, the cyclic sum equals exactly zero.
    On the discrete lattice, we allow O(ℓ_P) corrections.

    Physical justification:
    1. This identity is required for energy-momentum conservation
    2. Conservation laws are fundamental physical principles
    3. At scales >> ℓ_P, we recover the exact identity
    4. At Planck scale, discreteness may introduce small corrections

    The O(ℓ_P) bound reflects that:
    - Discrete geometry introduces errors proportional to lattice spacing
    - These vanish in the continuum limit ℓ_P → 0

    Falsifiable prediction:
    If energy-momentum conservation were violated by more than O(ℓ_P)
    at any scale, this axiom would be falsified.
