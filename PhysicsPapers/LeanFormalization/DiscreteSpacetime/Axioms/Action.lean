  Axioms.Action
  ==============

  Axioms for the action principle in Omega-Theory.

  This module establishes how physical transitions are governed by action:
  - Action is a real-valued quantity accumulated along paths
  - Transitions occur when action crosses quantized thresholds n*hbar
  - Action increases monotonically for systems with positive energy

  The key insight is that the action threshold mechanism replaces
  the continuous variational principle with a discrete triggering mechanism.

/-! ## Action Types -/

/-- The action of a physical system.
    Measured in units of hbar (reduced Planck constant).
    In Omega-Theory, action accumulates along world-lines and triggers
    transitions when crossing integer multiples of hbar. -/
abbrev Action := ℝ

/-- Convert action to dimensionless units (multiples of hbar) -/
noncomputable def Action.inPlanckUnits (S : Action) : ℝ := S / ℏ

/-- The Lagrangian at a single spacetime point.
    L = T - V (kinetic minus potential energy) -/
abbrev Lagrangian := ℝ

/-- Energy of a system (conserved for time-independent systems) -/
abbrev Energy := ℝ

/-! ## Action Quantization Axiom -/

/-- PHYSICS AXIOM: Action Quantization (Threshold Crossings)

    Physical transitions occur precisely when the accumulated action S
    crosses an integer multiple of hbar: S = n * hbar for n in Z.

    This replaces the continuous variational principle (delta S = 0) with
    a discrete mechanism:
    - Action accumulates continuously along a world-line
    - A "tick" or transition event occurs at each threshold crossing
    - Between thresholds, the system evolves deterministically
    - At thresholds, state transitions are triggered

    This cannot be proven mathematically; it is a physical postulate.

    Falsifiable prediction:
    - Quantum Zeno effect should show discrete transition timing
    - Ultra-precise atomic clocks should reveal quantized ticking
    - Photon emission times should cluster at action thresholds
-/
axiom action_quantized :
  -- Transitions occur at S = n * hbar crossings
  ∀ (S_before S_after : Action) (n : ℤ),
    -- If action crosses the threshold n * hbar
    (S_before < (n : ℝ) * ℏ ∧ S_after ≥ (n : ℝ) * ℏ) ∨
    (S_before > (n : ℝ) * ℏ ∧ S_after ≤ (n : ℝ) * ℏ) →
    -- Then a transition event occurs
    True  -- Placeholder: requires transition event formalism

/-- Predicate for an action threshold crossing.
    This occurs when action crosses from below to above (or above to below)
    an integer multiple of hbar. -/
structure ThresholdCrossing where
  /-- Action value just before the crossing -/
  S_before : Action
  /-- Action value just after the crossing -/
  S_after : Action
  /-- The threshold level being crossed -/
  n : ℤ
  /-- The crossing condition: S_before and S_after are on opposite sides of n*hbar -/
  crosses : (S_before < (n : ℝ) * ℏ ∧ S_after ≥ (n : ℝ) * ℏ) ∨
            (S_before > (n : ℝ) * ℏ ∧ S_after ≤ (n : ℝ) * ℏ)

/-- An upward threshold crossing (action increasing through threshold) -/
def ThresholdCrossing.isUpward (tc : ThresholdCrossing) : Prop :=
  tc.S_before < (tc.n : ℝ) * ℏ ∧ tc.S_after ≥ (tc.n : ℝ) * ℏ

/-- A downward threshold crossing (action decreasing through threshold) -/
def ThresholdCrossing.isDownward (tc : ThresholdCrossing) : Prop :=
  tc.S_before > (tc.n : ℝ) * ℏ ∧ tc.S_after ≤ (tc.n : ℝ) * ℏ

/-! ## Action Monotonicity Axiom -/

/-- PHYSICS AXIOM: Action Monotonicity

    For systems with positive total energy E > 0, action increases
    monotonically with time: dS/dt = L >= 0.

    More precisely:
    - For E > 0: The Lagrangian L is non-negative, so action grows
    - For E = 0: The system is static, action remains constant
    - For E < 0 (bound states): Action can oscillate but with bounded magnitude

    This provides a thermodynamic arrow of time at the microscopic level.

    This cannot be proven mathematically; it is a physical postulate.

    Falsifiable prediction:
    - Decay processes should always increase total action
    - Time-reversed processes would require action decrease (forbidden)
    - Perpetual motion would require cyclic action (impossible for E > 0)
-/
axiom action_monotonic :
  -- For positive energy systems, dS/dt >= 0
  ∀ (E : Energy) (L : Lagrangian),
    (E : ℝ) > 0 →
    -- The Lagrangian is non-negative
    (L : ℝ) ≥ 0

/-- The action rate (Lagrangian) for a system with given energy and configuration -/
noncomputable def actionRate (E : Energy) (kinetic potential : ℝ) : Lagrangian :=
  kinetic - potential

/-! ## Action Accumulation -/

/-- PHYSICS AXIOM: Action Additivity

    Action is additive along a path: if a path is divided into segments,
    the total action is the sum of the segment actions.

    S[gamma] = S[gamma_1] + S[gamma_2] + ... + S[gamma_n]

    This cannot be proven mathematically; it is a physical postulate.

    Falsifiable prediction: Any non-local contribution to action that
    depends on the entire path (not just local segments) would falsify this.
-/
axiom action_additive :
  -- Action along concatenated paths adds
  ∀ (S1 S2 : Action),
    -- Total action is the sum
    True  -- Placeholder: requires path formalism

/-- Accumulated action along a discrete time evolution.
    Given a sequence of Lagrangian values at each time step,
    the total action is the sum times the time step. -/
noncomputable def accumulatedAction (L_seq : List Lagrangian) : Action :=
  L_seq.sum * t_P

/-! ## Threshold Counting -/

/-- Count the number of threshold crossings in an action interval -/
noncomputable def thresholdCount (S_start S_end : Action) : ℤ :=
  Int.floor (S_end / ℏ) - Int.floor (S_start / ℏ)

/-- The number of threshold crossings is non-negative for increasing action -/
theorem thresholdCount_nonneg_of_increasing {S_start S_end : Action}
    (h : S_start ≤ S_end) : thresholdCount S_start S_end ≥ 0 := by
  unfold thresholdCount
  have := Int.floor_mono (div_le_div_of_nonneg_right h ReducedPlanck_pos.le)
  omega

/-! ## Transition Events -/

/-- A transition event triggered by an action threshold crossing -/
structure TransitionEvent where
  /-- The threshold crossing that triggered this event -/
  crossing : ThresholdCrossing
  /-- The spacetime location of the transition (discrete time step) -/
  time_step : ℤ

/-- The "tick rate" of a system: number of transitions per Planck time -/
noncomputable def tickRate (E : Energy) : ℝ :=
  (E : ℝ) / ℏ

/-- For a system with energy E, the time between ticks is hbar/E -/
noncomputable def tickPeriod (E : Energy) (hE : (E : ℝ) > 0) : ℝ :=
  ℏ / (E : ℝ)

/-- The tick period is positive for positive energy -/
theorem tickPeriod_pos (E : Energy) (hE : (E : ℝ) > 0) :
    tickPeriod E hE > 0 := by
  unfold tickPeriod
  apply div_pos ReducedPlanck_pos hE

/-! ## Connection to Quantum Mechanics -/

/-- PHYSICS AXIOM: Action-Phase Correspondence

    The accumulated action S corresponds to the quantum mechanical phase
    via phi = S / hbar.

    This connects the action threshold mechanism to:
    - Wave function phase: psi ~ exp(i * S / hbar)
    - Interference: constructive at S = 2*pi*n*hbar
    - Path integral: dominant paths have stationary action

    This cannot be proven mathematically; it is a physical postulate.

    Falsifiable prediction:
    - Interference patterns should reflect action differences
    - Aharonov-Bohm effect should depend on enclosed action
-/
axiom action_phase_correspondence :
  -- phi = S / hbar
  ∀ (S : Action),
    -- Phase is action in Planck units
    True  -- Placeholder: requires complex phase formalism

/-- The quantum phase corresponding to an action -/
noncomputable def quantumPhase (S : Action) : ℝ := S / ℏ

/-- The action corresponding to one complete phase cycle (2*pi) -/
noncomputable def actionPerCycle : Action := 2 * Real.pi * ℏ
