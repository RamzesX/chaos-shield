  Metric defects in discrete spacetime: deviations from the exact continuum metric.

  This module defines the mathematical structure of spacetime defects:
  - ExactMetric: The "true" continuum metric that spacetime is trying to achieve
  - DefectTensor: D_μν(p) = g_μν(p) - g^exact_μν(p)
  - DefectMagnitude: |D| = sqrt(g^{μρ} g^{νσ} D_μν D_ρσ)
  - DefectDensity: Defect magnitude per volume element
  - DefectSet: The set of points where defects exceed a threshold

  Key insight: Defects arise from finite computational resources. The universe
  cannot compute the exact metric everywhere, so approximation errors (defects)
  occur. More computational budget means fewer defects.

  Physical interpretation:
  - Defects represent local deviations from smooth Riemannian geometry
  - They may manifest as discrete curvature corrections
  - In regions of high curvature (black holes, early universe), defects concentrate
  - Healing dynamics drive defects toward zero

/-! ## Exact (Target) Metric -/

/-- The exact metric is the continuum limit that the discrete metric aspires to.
    This represents the "true" geometry of spacetime that would exist with
    infinite computational resources.

    Physically, this is the solution to Einstein's equations in the continuum limit.
    The discrete metric g_μν(p) is the computational approximation. -/

  /-- The exact metric at each lattice point -/
  metric : DiscreteMetric
  /-- The exact metric is everywhere Lorentzian -/
  lorentzian : DiscreteMetric.IsEverywhereLorentzian metric
  /-- The exact metric is smooth (satisfies regularity conditions) -/

/-- Flat Minkowski spacetime as an exact metric -/
noncomputable def ExactMetric.flat : ExactMetric :=
  ⟨DiscreteMetric.flat, DiscreteMetric.flat_everywhere_lorentzian, trivial⟩

/-! ## Defect Tensor -/

/-- The defect tensor measures the deviation of the discrete metric from the exact metric.
    D_μν(p) = g_μν(p) - g^exact_μν(p)

    Properties:
    - D = 0 means perfect agreement with continuum
    - D ≠ 0 indicates computational approximation error
    - D inherits symmetry from the metric tensors -/

/-! ## Defect Magnitude -/

/-- The squared magnitude of the defect tensor at a point.
    |D|² = g^{μρ} g^{νσ} D_μν D_ρσ

    This is the natural norm on symmetric tensors induced by the metric.
    It measures the "size" of the defect in a coordinate-invariant way. -/

/-! ## Defect Density -/

/-- The defect density: defect magnitude per Planck volume.
    ρ_D(p) = |D(p)| / ℓ_P⁴

    This gives a volume-normalized measure of local defect concentration.
    High defect density indicates regions where the geometry is poorly approximated. -/

  points.sum fun p => defectMagnitude D p

/-! ## Defect Set -/

/-- The defect set: points where the defect magnitude exceeds a threshold.
    DefectSet(D, ε) = { p ∈ Λ | |D(p)| > ε }

    Physical interpretation:
    - Points in the defect set require correction
    - Healing dynamics prioritize these regions
    - The threshold ε sets the precision requirement -/
def DefectSet (D : DefectTensor) (threshold : ℝ) : Set LatticePoint :=
  { p | defectMagnitude D p > threshold }

/-- The defect set is empty when defects are everywhere below threshold -/

/-! ## Defect Sparsity Theorem -/

/-- PHYSICS AXIOM: Defect Sparsity Bound

    The fraction of lattice points with significant defects decreases
    exponentially with computational budget:

    |DefectSet|/|Λ| ≤ C · exp(-α · N_max)

    where:
    - |DefectSet| is the number of points with |D| > threshold
    - |Λ| is the total number of lattice points
    - N_max is the computational budget
    - C, α are positive constants

    Physical interpretation:
    - More computational resources → fewer defects
    - Defects are sparse, not dense
    - The universe "mostly gets it right" with finite computation

    This cannot be proven mathematically; it is a physical postulate.

    Falsifiable prediction:
    - High-precision measurements should find defects sparse
    - Defect concentration should correlate with curvature/energy density
    - Information theoretic bounds on defect density

    Mathematical note:
    - This theorem requires finite lattice regions
    - The statement involves Finset.card for counting
    - Exponential suppression is motivated by statistical mechanics
-/
axiom defect_sparsity :
  ∀ (D : DefectTensor) (threshold : ℝ) (hpos : threshold > 0)

/-! ## Defect Energy -/

/-- The energy associated with defects.
    Defects carry energy, which drives their healing.

    E_defect = ∫_Λ ρ_D(p) · (E_P / ℓ_P) d⁴x

    This is the energy cost of maintaining defects against healing. -/

  (points.sum fun p => defectMagnitude D p) * E_P

/-- Defect energy is non-negative -/

    defectEnergy (DefectTensor.zero g) points = 0 := by
  unfold defectEnergy
  simp only [zero_defect_magnitude, Finset.sum_const_zero, zero_mul]

/-! ## Defect Gradients -/

/-- The gradient of defect magnitude across the lattice.
    Healing flows are driven by these gradients - defects flow
    from high-magnitude regions to low-magnitude regions. -/
noncomputable def defectGradient (D : DefectTensor) : LatticeVectorField :=
  discreteGradient (fun p => defectMagnitude D p)

/-- Defect flux: the flow of defect magnitude through surfaces -/
noncomputable def defectFlux (D : DefectTensor) (p : LatticePoint) (μ : SpacetimeIndex) : ℝ :=
  defectGradient D p μ

/-- Directional derivative of defect tensor component.
    D.defect μ ν p dir = ∂_dir D_{μν}(p)

    This gives the rate of change of the defect tensor in direction dir.
    Used in emergent torsion calculations. -/
