# Omega-Theory Lean 4 Formalization

Machine-verified proofs for the discrete spacetime physics framework.

## Overview

This is one of the first formal verifications of a unified physics framework. Unlike typical physics papers that rely on informal mathematical arguments, Omega-Theory's core results are proven in **Lean 4** with **Mathlib v4.13.0**.

**Key Achievement**: 36 Lean files, 10,000+ lines of verified proofs, **zero `sorry`** in core theorems.

## What Is Being Formalized

The formalization covers the mathematical foundations of Omega-Theory:

1. **Discrete Spacetime Structure** - The Planck lattice $\Lambda = \ell_P \cdot \mathbb{Z}^4$
2. **Physical Constants** - Planck units and their relationships
3. **Discrete Differential Geometry** - Metric, connection, curvature on lattice
4. **Conservation Laws** - Including the novel Fourth Noether Law
5. **Computational Bounds** - Irrational approximation and uncertainty
6. **Emergence** - How continuous physics emerges from discrete foundations

## Building

See [BUILD.md](BUILD.md) for detailed instructions.

**Quick start** (requires WSL with elan installed):

```bash
wsl.exe bash -c "cd /mnt/c/Users/Norbert/IdeaProjects/chaos-shield/PhysicsPapers/LeanFormalization && ~/.elan/bin/lake exe cache get && ~/.elan/bin/lake build --log-level=error 2>&1"
```

## Requirements

- WSL2 with Ubuntu
- Elan (Lean version manager)
- Mathlib v4.13.0 (specified in lakefile.lean)

## Why Formal Verification Matters

1. **Mathematical Rigor** - Every step is machine-checked
2. **No Hidden Assumptions** - All axioms are explicit
3. **Reproducibility** - Anyone can verify the proofs
4. **Foundation for Extensions** - New theorems build on verified base
