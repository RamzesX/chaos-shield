# Hardware Security Architecture

Technical feasibility studies for advanced authentication systems.

## Papers

### 1. YubiKey + eSIM Infrastructure
**File**: [`YubiKey-eSIM-Government-Infrastructure-Security-Paper.md`](YubiKey-eSIM-Government-Infrastructure-Security-Paper.md)

Premium hardware authentication token with cellular connectivity:
- Targets "critical 5%" of users (C-suite, financial, classified access)
- Multi-layer security: physical + cryptographic + cellular + policy
- Business case: $140 price point, $113M savings at 1B users
- 24-month phased implementation roadmap
- EU labor law compliance (GDPR, working time directive)

### 2. GPS Authentication Architecture
**File**: [`GPS-Authentication-Verification-Architecture.md`](GPS-Authentication-Verification-Architecture.md)

Anti-spoofing architecture for GPS-based authentication:
- Hardware-level GPS validation (OSNMA, multi-constellation)
- Cryptographic binding via secure element
- Policy engine for geofencing and time-based access

## Status

These are the most production-ready documents in the repository, with detailed specifications and cost analysis suitable for actual product development.

## Note

These papers represent applied security engineering research, independent of the theoretical physics work in [PhysicsPapers](../PhysicsPapers/).
