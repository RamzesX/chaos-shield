    <paper_abstract_draft>
        We identify two "original sins" of mathematics: first, claiming √2 exists rather than 
        defining it (500 BCE), and second, imposing continuity without knowing physics is 
        quantum (1687-1821). These sins led to every mathematical paradox, from Zeno to 
        Banach-Tarski. We show that ALL paradoxes stem from assuming actual infinity, while 
        physics has NO paradoxes because nature is finite and discrete. We present Recursive 
        Mathematics: using only ℤ and ℚ, treating everything else as notation for convergent 
        processes. This dissolves Gödel's incompleteness, eliminates paradoxes, and perfectly 
        matches both computation (all discrete) and physics (quantum). Mathematics isn't the 
        study of infinite objects but the art of finite approximation.

    <handoff_instructions>
        TO CONTINUE THIS WORK:
        1. Load this handoff document
        2. Query Neo4j for namespace='recursive_math' nodes
        3. Review the 130+ nodes and their relationships
        4. Focus on paper writing and computational examples
        5. Use CYPHER 25 prefix for all queries
        6. Update 06_PENDING_TASKS.xml with progress
        
        KEY QUERIES TO RUN:
        - MATCH (n {namespace: 'recursive_math'}) RETURN n
        - MATCH (sin:PhilosophicalImplication) WHERE sin.name CONTAINS 'Sin' RETURN sin
        - MATCH (p:InfinityParadox) RETURN p
        - MATCH (c:Challenge) RETURN c

    <final_thought>
        Mathematics has been trying to describe a discrete, finite universe using continuous, 
        infinite tools. No wonder we got paradoxes! Recursive mathematics simply aligns our 
        mathematical tools with physical reality. The "unreasonable effectiveness" of mathematics 
        becomes reasonable: discrete math describes discrete reality perfectly.
