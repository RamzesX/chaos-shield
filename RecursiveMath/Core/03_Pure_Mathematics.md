# Pure Mathematics in Conv(ℚ): From Arithmetic to Topology

## Foundations: Number Theory and Algebra

The Conv(ℚ) framework suggests an intriguing possibility: that the deepest structures of pure mathematics might be expressible through rational convergence alone. We begin with number theory, where this proposal finds perhaps its most natural home.

### Arithmetic Without the Continuum

Consider Fermat's Last Theorem, finally proven by Andrew Wiles through sophisticated machinery involving elliptic curves and modular forms. The Conv(ℚ) perspective proposes that this entire proof structure might be reformulated using only rational approximations and convergent sequences.

For instance, the elliptic curves central to Wiles' proof:
```
y² = x³ + ax + b  (a, b ∈ ℚ)
```

traditionally require complex analysis and p-adic numbers. Yet perhaps we can work entirely with rational points and their limiting behavior. The Mordell-Weil theorem tells us that the rational points form a finitely generated abelian group — a structure naturally suited to our framework.

### Galois Theory Through Convergence

Évariste Galois revolutionized algebra by connecting field extensions to group theory. In Conv(ℚ), we propose that Galois groups might be understood as symmetries of convergent rational sequences.

Consider the polynomial x² - 2. Classically, its splitting field is ℚ(√2). In our framework, we suggest working with:
```
ℚ^conv(√2) = {sequences converging to √2 behavior}
```

The Galois group action becomes a permutation of convergent sequences rather than abstract field automorphisms. This perspective aligns with the computational practice in computer algebra systems, which never actually compute with "real" algebraic numbers but rather with increasingly precise rational approximations.

### Groups and Their Representations

The classification of finite simple groups — one of the 20th century's greatest achievements — relies heavily on character theory over ℂ. Yet we propose that character tables might be understood purely through rational arithmetic.

As Hermann Weyl noted, representation theory is essentially linear algebra. Since linear algebra over ℚ is complete and decidable, perhaps the entire theory of finite groups can be developed without ever leaving the rationals. The sporadic groups, including the Monster with its 196,883-dimensional representation, might be fully describable through rational matrices and their convergent powers.

## Analysis and Geometry

### Differential Structures Without Infinitesimals

The development of manifold theory traditionally requires smooth functions and tangent spaces. Bishop's constructive analysis suggests an alternative: perhaps smoothness is merely uniform convergence of difference quotients.

Consider a manifold M. Rather than defining it through smooth charts, we might characterize it through:
- Rational coordinate patches
- Convergent transition functions
- Discrete approximations that refine consistently

The sphere S², classically defined as {(x,y,z) ∈ ℝ³ : x² + y² + z² = 1}, becomes in our framework:
```
S²_ℚ = {(x,y,z) ∈ ℚ³ : |x² + y² + z² - 1| < 1/n for chosen precision n}
```

### Topology Through Rational Approximation

Algebraic topology — the study of spaces through algebraic invariants — seems particularly amenable to our approach. The fundamental group π₁, already defined through word reduction and relations, needs no real numbers.

Homology groups, computed through linear algebra:
```
Hₙ(X) = Ker(∂ₙ)/Im(∂ₙ₊₁)
```

work perfectly over ℚ. Even the sophisticated machinery of spectral sequences reduces to organized linear algebra computations — all performable with rational coefficients.

### Lie Groups and Lie Algebras

Sophus Lie's theory of continuous groups might seem to require the continuum essentially. Yet we propose that matrix groups over ℚ, together with their formal exponential maps, capture the essential structure.

The exponential map:
```
exp(A) = I + A + A²/2! + A³/3! + ...
```

converges for rational matrices A. The Lie algebra structure [X,Y] = XY - YX is purely algebraic. Perhaps the entire theory of Lie groups can be developed through rational approximations to these matrix groups.

## Category Theory and Modern Algebra

### Categories as Convergence Patterns

Category theory, that most abstract of mathematical frameworks, might paradoxically be the most naturally suited to Conv(ℚ). We propose that functors themselves encode convergence patterns.

Consider the fundamental example of the fundamental group functor:
```
π₁: Top → Grp
```

In our framework, this becomes a map from rationally-approximated spaces to discrete groups — both perfectly constructive notions.

### Homological Algebra

The derived category, cohomology theories, and spectral sequences that pervade modern mathematics all reduce, ultimately, to elaborate bookkeeping of linear maps. Since linear algebra over ℚ is algorithmic and decidable, perhaps all of homological algebra can be reformulated constructively.

Consider the long exact sequence in cohomology:
```
... → Hⁱ⁻¹(A) → Hⁱ⁻¹(B) → Hⁱ⁻¹(C) → Hⁱ(A) → ...
```

Each map is ℚ-linear, each group is ℚ-vector space. The entire machinery works without any appeal to the continuum.

## Transcendental Structures

### π and e Through Series

The transcendental nature of π and e has long fascinated mathematicians. Lindemann proved π transcendental in 1882, seemingly placing it beyond algebraic reach. Yet from the Conv(ℚ) perspective, we need never treat π as a completed object.

Instead, we work with rapidly converging series:
```
π via Ramanujan: increasingly precise rational approximations
e via Taylor: 1 + 1 + 1/2 + 1/6 + 1/24 + ...
```

Each partial sum is rational. For any calculation requiring these "constants," we simply compute to sufficient precision. This approach aligns perfectly with computational practice.

### Special Functions

The Riemann zeta function, central to the distribution of primes:
```
ζ(s) = Σ 1/n^s
```

can be evaluated at rational points to arbitrary rational precision. The celebrated Riemann Hypothesis might be reformulated as a statement about the convergence behavior of certain rational sequences rather than zeros in the complex plane.

## Geometric and Arithmetic Synthesis

### Schemes and Algebraic Geometry

Grothendieck's revolutionary notion of schemes might seem to require the full machinery of commutative algebra. Yet we propose that schemes over ℚ, together with formal completions, might suffice.

The spectrum of a ring:
```
Spec(ℚ[x₁,...,xₙ]/I)
```

consists of prime ideals — a purely algebraic notion requiring no continuum. Even étale cohomology, seemingly dependent on topology, reduces to Galois actions on finite groups.

### The Langlands Program

Robert Langlands proposed vast correspondences between number theory and representation theory. The Conv(ℚ) framework suggests these correspondences might be understood as relationships between different convergent rational structures.

Automorphic forms become ℚ-Fourier series. L-functions become generating series with rational coefficients. The entire web of correspondences might be navigable without ever leaving the rational numbers.

## Reflections on Pure Mathematics

This exploration suggests — tentatively, humbly — that pure mathematics from arithmetic to topology might be expressible through rational convergence. We do not claim to have proven this; rather, we propose it as a research program worthy of investigation.

The advantages of such a reformulation would include:
- Complete algorithmic content for all theorems
- Alignment with computational practice
- Avoidance of set-theoretic paradoxes
- Natural interpretation in constructive type theory

We acknowledge the skepticism this proposal might generate. After all, the real numbers have served mathematics well for centuries. Yet perhaps, following Bishop and Brouwer, we might find that constructive clarity brings its own rewards.

The examples presented here — from Fermat to Langlands — suggest that Conv(ℚ) provides not a restriction but a clarification. Perhaps the Pythagoreans' vision, augmented with the modern notion of convergence, captures more of mathematical truth than we have previously imagined.
