## How Can I Contribute?

### üêõ Reporting Issues

- **Mathematical Errors**: If you find errors in proofs or theorems, please open an issue with:
  - The specific file and section
  - A clear description of the error
  - If possible, a suggested correction

- **Conceptual Clarifications**: If something is unclear or could be explained better:
  - Reference the specific section
  - Explain what's confusing
  - Suggest how it might be improved

### üí° Suggesting Enhancements

- **New Theorems or Proofs**: We welcome extensions to the theoretical framework
- **Applications**: Practical implementations of the concepts
- **Connections**: Links to other areas of mathematics or computer science
