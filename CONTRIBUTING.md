## Philosophy

> *"Good science should be fun, falsifiable, and useful."*

We welcome contributions that:
- Make the framework more testable
- Find errors (falsification is valuable!)
- Extend applications
- Improve clarity

Even if you think the framework is wrong—tell us WHY. That's valuable science.

## Code of Conduct

- Respectful scientific discourse
- Constructive criticism welcome
- Focus on ideas, not individuals
- Acknowledge uncertainty honestly
