  Chaos Shield is a collection of theoretical frameworks exploring the intersection
  of mathematics, quantum computing, and security. It introduces Conv(â„š), a
  constructive mathematical framework that restricts mathematics to computationally
  meaningful objects, and presents novel quantum-resistant security protocols based
  on economic exhaustion through traffic obfuscation. The work bridges theoretical
  computer science, mathematical philosophy, and practical system design.
