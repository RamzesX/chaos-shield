  Chaos Shield is a collection of theoretical frameworks exploring the intersection
  of mathematics, quantum computing, physics, and security. It introduces Conv(ℚ), a
  constructive mathematical framework that restricts mathematics to computationally
  meaningful objects, presents novel quantum-resistant security protocols based
  on economic exhaustion through traffic obfuscation, and proposes a revolutionary
  discrete spacetime theory where mass emerges from geometric reshaping costs and
  quantum uncertainty arises from computational deadlines imposed by action thresholds.
  The physics framework (13 papers) includes testable predictions for quantum computing
  error rates, explains why cryogenic cooling buys computational time for irrational
  number calculations, and resolves quantum entanglement paradoxes through hidden
  dimensional proximity. The work bridges theoretical physics, mathematical philosophy,
  quantum computing engineering, and practical system design.
