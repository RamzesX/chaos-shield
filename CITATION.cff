  Ω-Theory (Chaos Shield) presents a unified physics framework originating from a simple
  question: "What if everything wants to teleport at the speed of light—but we can't,
  because we have mass, and need to expend energy to reshape the geometry around us?"
  
  From this insight, the framework develops:
  
  1. DISCRETE SPACETIME: Reality is a Planck-scale lattice (Λ = ℓ_P × ℤ⁴)
  
  2. MASS AS RESHAPING COST: Massive particles pay energy to reshape local geometry
     with each quantum jump—this toll manifests as rest mass (E = mc²)
  
  3. QUANTUM UNCERTAINTY: Arises from computational truncation of irrational numbers
     (π, e, √2) under action threshold deadlines (S = nℏ)
  
  4. INFORMATION CONSERVATION: Fourth Noether law (∂_μJ^μ_I = 0) from which other
     conservation laws derive
  
  5. QUANTUM ENTANGLEMENT: Topologically unstable wormholes in hidden dimension D_ent
     that collapse upon measurement via Lyapunov healing flow
  
  6. STABLE WORMHOLES: Three-tier classification—natural (black holes, devastating),
     information (maintained, safe), mass (heavily maintained, traversable). Time travel
     impossible because CTCs violate information conservation.
  
  7. CHRONOLOGY PROTECTION: Automatic—the same mass that stabilizes wormholes prevents
     relativistic manipulation into time machines.
  
  The framework makes testable predictions validated by recent data: quantum error rates
  scale with action density ρ_S = NkT/V (power-law T^(-2.5), not Arrhenius exponential),
  confirmed by Diraq/Nature 2024 spin qubit experiments.
  
  Total: 18 physics papers, 14 mathematics papers, 3 security papers.
  
  Philosophy: Good science should be FUN, FALSIFIABLE, and USEFUL.
